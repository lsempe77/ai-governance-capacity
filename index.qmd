title: "AI Governance Capacity"
subtitle: "A cross-national analysis of 2,216 AI policies across 193 countries"

## About this project

This project analyses 2,216 AI policy documents from 193 countries, drawn from the [OECD.AI Policy Observatory](https://oecd.ai), to answer a straightforward question:

> **Do countries have the capacity to implement their AI policies, and how does this vary between high-income and developing countries?**

Three complementary lenses — implementation capacity, ethics governance depth, and UNESCO alignment — are used to trace how AI governance performs from the abstract (values) to the concrete (policy actions). The central finding is that ethical principles are widely endorsed but rarely operationalised: accountability mechanisms are the most systematically omitted governance feature worldwide.

All work is in progress. Comments and feedback are welcome.

## Research volumes

The analysis is presented in four companion volumes:
