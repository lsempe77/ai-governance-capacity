## How Robust Are Capacity Findings? {#sec-robustness}

I stress-test capacity findings through text quality restrictions, bootstrap CIs, cluster stability, and sensitivity analyses. The bottom line: the income-group **capacity gap vanishes** when restricted to well-documented policies.

### The Text Quality Confound {#sec-text-quality}

All capacity findings rest on an underlying assumption: that policy text accurately reflects implementation infrastructure. If text availability varies by income group—with wealthy countries publishing complete PDFs while developing countries' policies appear as summaries—then apparent capacity gaps may reflect **documentation quality** rather than **governance quality**.

Text quality operates through three mechanisms:

- **Length effects**: Longer documents provide more opportunities to detect capacity features (resources, authorities, accountability mechanisms)
- **Detail effects**: Detailed descriptions score higher than brief mentions even when infrastructure is equivalent
- **Extraction effects**: Complete PDFs enable full-text analysis; summaries systematically underrepresent content

#### The Capacity Gap Disappears

| Sample Restriction | N | Capacity $d$ | Interpretation |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| All texts | 2,097 | **+0.30*** | Modest gap |
| **Good-text (≥500 words)** | 948 | **+0.04 (n.s.)** | **Gap vanishes** |
| Excluding stubs | 1,754 | +0.23*** | Partial reduction |

: Income-group capacity effect by text quality {#tbl-capacity-text}

Here is the headline: the capacity gap shrinks by **87%** (from d=0.30 to d=0.04) when restricted to well-documented policies. At d=0.04, income-group distributions overlap by 98.5%—knowing a policy comes from a high-income versus developing country gives essentially **zero information** about capacity scores once text quality is controlled.

**Mechanistic interpretation**: High-income countries publish complete policy documents (mean 2,847 words); developing countries' policies more often appear as brief summaries (mean 1,456 words). When scoring a 50-word stub, LLMs detect fewer capacity features—not because infrastructure is absent, but because text lacks detail to reveal it.

**Three interpretations**:

1. **Measurement artifact** (favored): Apparent gap reflects documentation quality; developing countries with well-documented policies match wealthy countries' capacity
2. **Selection**: Well-documented developing-country policies represent high-capacity subset
3. **Hybrid**: Both mechanisms operate

Evidence favors measurement artifacts: the gap doesn't merely shrink—it disappears and approaches zero. Selection would produce reduced but still-significant gaps.

**Interpretive caution.** This doesn't prove *no* capacity gap exists—it proves our methodology cannot reliably detect gaps after controlling for documentation quality. The "true" gap likely lies between full-sample (d=0.30) and good-text (d=0.04) estimates.

### Additional Robustness Checks

**Bootstrap CIs** (1,000 resamples): Capacity d = 0.30 [0.19, 0.41]. Narrow intervals indicate low sampling variability, but this precision doesn't address validity—text quality shows the estimate measures documentation, not capacity.

**Cluster stability**: Two-cluster solution ("Low" vs "Moderate" capacity) is optimal. Silhouette = 0.41 for k=2, declining to 0.33 (k=3), 0.28 (k=4), 0.25 (k=5). The binary typology holds up.

**Sensitivity tests** (full details in @sec-appendix-robustness):
- Excluding international organizations: Results unchanged
- Ordinal regression: Rank ordering preserved
- Winsorizing extremes: Coefficients stable within 10%
- Alternative income classifications: Conclusions robust across 2/3/4-group models
- Text quality thresholds (300-1000 words): Gaps shrink monotonically with increasing thresholds
- Temporal subsamples: Patterns persist 2017-2020 and 2021-2025

### Summary

| Finding | Robust? | Caveat |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Income-group capacity gap | ⚠️ **Fragile** | Vanishes for good texts |
| GDP modest capacity effect | ✅ Yes | Consistent across models |
| Within-group inequality (98%) | ✅ Yes | All specifications |
| Horizontal diffusion | ✅ Yes | Robust pattern |
| Efficiency frontier countries | ✅ Yes | Rwanda, Kenya, Brazil consistent |

: Capacity robustness summary {#tbl-capacity-robustness}

Core findings (GDP effects, within-group inequality, frontier countries, horizontal diffusion) are **highly robust**. The one fragile finding: the income-group gap itself—the **single most important caveat** for policy interpretation.
