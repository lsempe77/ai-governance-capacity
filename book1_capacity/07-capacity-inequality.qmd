## Within vs. Between: Decomposing the Governance Gap {#sec-cap-inequality}

### Inequality Decomposition {#sec-cap-gini}

The regression analysis showed GDP explaining remarkably little. But *how* is inequality structured? Two scenarios are consistent with weak GDP effects. In one, the income-group gap is small but stable, with most variation occurring within countries. In the other, the gap is substantial but drowned out by enormous within-group heterogeneity. Distinguishing these requires formal inequality decomposition.

![Lorenz curves for capacity scores, by income group and overall. Both groups exhibit substantial inequality, with developing countries showing slightly more concentration.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/extended/fig_lorenz.png){#fig-cap-lorenz}

@fig-cap-lorenz presents Lorenz curves visualizing inequality within and between income groups. If capacity were equally distributed, policies would fall along the 45-degree line where each percentile of policies accounts for its proportional share of total capacity. The observed curves bow below this line, indicating concentration: top-scoring policies capture disproportionate shares of total capacity. The Gini coefficient quantifies this departure from perfect equality:

| Metric | Value |
|:---|---:|
| Gini (all countries) | 0.518 |
| Gini (HI only) | 0.499 |
| Gini (Developing) | 0.593 |
| Gini (country means) | 0.235 |

The overall Gini of **0.518** indicates substantial inequality, comparable to income inequality in a moderately unequal country. The surprise is where it concentrates: **developing countries have higher within-group inequality (0.593) than high-income countries (0.499)**. The spread among developing countries, from Brazil and Colombia at one end to countries with minimal AI governance at the other, exceeds the spread among wealthy nations.

If developing countries were uniformly weak, their within-group Gini would be low. Instead, 0.593 signals enormous heterogeneity. The "developing country" label obscures more than it reveals, conflating high-performers with countries barely on the AI governance map.

The country-means Gini (0.235) is less than half the overall (0.518), confirming that aggregating to the country level eliminates much variation. Most inequality lives at the policy level within countries.

#### Theil Decomposition

The Gini suggested within-group inequality dominates, but cannot quantify exactly how much. Theil's T index can: it decomposes perfectly into between-group and within-group components.

![Theil decomposition of capacity inequality: 98.8% within groups, only 1.2% between income groups.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/extended/fig_theil_decomposition.png){#fig-cap-theil}

@fig-cap-theil visualizes the decomposition. The formal results are even starker than the Gini coefficients suggested:

| Component | Share |
|:---|---:|
| **Between** income groups | **1.2%** |
| **Within** income groups | **98.8%** |

: Theil decomposition of capacity inequality {#tbl-cap-theil}

The numbers are stark: **the income-group label explains 1.2% of total capacity inequality**. The remaining **98.8% sits within income groups**. Knowing whether a country is "high-income" or "developing" tells you almost nothing about its governance capacity.

To put this in perspective: the variation between Luxembourg's sophisticated framework and a smaller European country's minimal AI governance dwarfs the average gap between high-income and developing groups. Afghanistan and Brazil are both "developing," yet their governance capacity differs more than the average cross-group difference.

The same pattern appeared in the multilevel analysis (91% within-country variance; @sec-cap-determinants), but the concentration here is even more extreme. The policy implication is direct: development interventions targeting "developing countries" as a category will misallocate resources, assisting Brazil and Colombia (which have already achieved strong capacity) while potentially neglecting wealthy countries with weak frameworks.

### Policy Portfolio Breadth {#sec-cap-portfolio}

Is the capacity gap about *breadth* (developing countries missing entire dimensions) or *depth* (covering the same dimensions but with less detail)? The distinction matters: if countries miss dimensions, interventions should ensure comprehensive frameworks; if they cover all dimensions shallowly, the focus should be on strengthening existing areas.

![Heatmap of policy portfolio coverage by country and dimension. Most countries cover all five dimensions in at least one policy.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/extended/fig_portfolio_heatmap.png){#fig-cap-portfolio-heatmap}

@fig-cap-portfolio-heatmap maps policy portfolio coverage across countries and dimensions, revealing that most jurisdictions — regardless of income — address all five capacity dimensions in at least some policy. The heatmap shows dense coverage rather than systematic gaps, suggesting that breadth deficits prove less consequential than depth variations.

![Portfolio breadth gap between income groups, by dimension. C4 Accountability shows the largest coverage gap.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/extended/fig_portfolio_gaps.png){#fig-cap-portfolio-gaps}

@fig-cap-portfolio-gaps quantifies dimensional coverage differences between income groups, revealing that gaps concentrate in specific dimensions rather than reflecting uniform undercoverage:

| Metric | HI | Developing | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| Mean breadth (out of 5) | 4.95 | 4.52 | .137 |
| Countries with 5/5 coverage | 93% | — | — |
| Least covered dimension | C4 (92.6%) | C4 (92.6%) | — |

: Policy portfolio breadth by income group {#tbl-cap-portfolio}

The breadth gap is **not statistically significant** (p = .137). High-income countries average 4.95 dimensions out of 5; developing countries average 4.52. Both groups cover most dimensions. And both groups share the same weakest link: **C4 Accountability** is the most commonly missing dimension across both groups (92.6% coverage).

So the capacity gap is **about depth, not breadth**. Developing countries recognize the same governance requirements; they just provide less implementation detail within each dimension.

### K-Means Clustering {#sec-cap-clusters}

Do distinct governance *typologies* exist, recognizable archetypes with characteristic dimensional profiles? I use K-means clustering to find out, with optimal k determined by silhouette analysis.

![Radar chart of capacity dimension profiles for the two identified clusters. Cluster 1 ("Low Capacity") shows uniformly low scores; Cluster 2 ("Moderate Capacity") shows elevation across all dimensions.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/fig_cluster_radar.png){#fig-cap-cluster-radar}

Two clusters emerge (k = 2, silhouette = 0.41). They differ in *level* rather than *shape*: both show the same relative strengths and weaknesses, just at different absolute heights.

**Cluster 1 ("Low Capacity", ~60% of policies)**: Uniformly low scores (0–1 range). Aspirational statements, preliminary frameworks, brief announcements. Both income groups contribute.

**Cluster 2 ("Moderate Capacity", ~40%)**: Elevated across dimensions (1.5–3 range), with the usual weaknesses in Resources and Accountability. Again, both income groups are represented.

The fact that **both clusters contain policies from both income groups** reinforces the main point: the distinction between low-capacity and moderate-capacity governance matters more than the distinction between rich and poor countries. The k = 2 solution (stable under bootstrap; see @sec-robustness) suggests AI governance capacity operates as a continuum from absent to present, not as distinct regulatory philosophies.
