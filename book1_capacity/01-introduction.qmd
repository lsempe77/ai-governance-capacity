## The Capacity Challenge in AI Governance {#sec-intro}

### The Implementation Gap

Between 2017 and 2025, governments worldwide produced over 2,200 AI policy initiatives catalogued in the OECD.AI Policy Observatory. While impressive in quantity, this proliferation sidesteps a question that governance research has largely neglected:

> **Can governments actually implement their AI policies?**

Implementation capacity, defined as the institutional infrastructure enabling policy execution, remains unmeasured in AI governance. While existing research documents policy content, the presence of clarity, resources, authority, accountability structures, and coordination mechanisms necessary to translate commitments into action remains unexamined.

### What We Measure

This study assesses each policy along five capacity dimensions:

1. **C1 Clarity**: How specific are the objectives and implementation plans?
2. **C2 Resources**: Are budgets, staffing, and technical infrastructure identified?
3. **C3 Authority**: Does the policy carry legal mandates and enforcement powers?
4. **C4 Accountability**: Are there oversight mechanisms, reporting requirements, review processes?
5. **C5 Coherence**: Is there inter-agency coordination and consistency with existing frameworks?

Scores range from 0 to 4, anchored in detailed rubrics drawn from implementation science [@mazmanian1983; @pressman1973].

Most AI policies lack robust implementation infrastructure. The average capacity score across 2,100+ policies is 0.83 out of 4.0, well below the scale midpoint. However, the distributional patterns prove more revealing than aggregate statistics. The modest income-group gap effectively vanishes when the sample is restricted to well-documented policies, suggesting that apparent capacity differences may primarily reflect variation in documentation practices rather than genuine governance gaps. Within-group variation accounts for nearly all total inequality, dwarfing the between-group gap. Several developing countries—including Brazil, Kenya, and Rwanda—consistently exceed predictions based on GDP levels, while policy diffusion operates horizontally across income peers rather than through vertical transfer from wealthy nations.

The book proceeds as follows: @sec-literature reviews the theoretical foundations; @sec-methods-summary outlines data and scoring (with full details in the companion *Data, Methods, and Technical Appendices* volume); @sec-cap-landscape maps the global landscape; @sec-cap-determinants examines determinants; @sec-cap-inequality analyses inequality patterns; @sec-cap-dynamics traces temporal trends and diffusion; @sec-robustness presents robustness checks; and @sec-discussion and @sec-conclusion discuss implications.
