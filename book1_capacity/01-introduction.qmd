## The Capacity Challenge in AI Governance {#sec-intro}

### The Implementation Gap

Between 2017 and 2025, governments worldwide produced over 2,200 AI policy initiatives catalogued in the OECD.AI Policy Observatory. That number sounds impressive. But it sidesteps a question that governance research has largely neglected:

> **Can governments actually implement their AI policies?**

Implementation capacity, defined as the institutional infrastructure enabling policy execution, remains unmeasured in AI governance. We know what policies say. We do not know whether governments have the clarity, resources, authority, accountability structures, or coordination mechanisms to translate those commitments into action.

### What We Measure

I assess each policy along five capacity dimensions:

1. **C1 Clarity**: How specific are the objectives and implementation plans?
2. **C2 Resources**: Are budgets, staffing, and technical infrastructure identified?
3. **C3 Authority**: Does the policy carry legal mandates and enforcement powers?
4. **C4 Accountability**: Are there oversight mechanisms, reporting requirements, review processes?
5. **C5 Coherence**: Is there inter-agency coordination and consistency with existing frameworks?

Scores range from 0 to 4, anchored in detailed rubrics drawn from implementation science [@mazmanian1983; @pressman1973].

### What I Found

Most AI policies lack robust implementation infrastructure. The average score across 2,100+ policies is just 1.38 out of 4.0.

But the more interesting story is distributional. The raw income-group gap (d = 0.30) vanishes (d = 0.04) once I restrict the sample to well-documented policies, suggesting that what looks like a capacity divide may actually reflect differences in how countries *document* their policies. Within-group variation accounts for 98% of total inequality, dwarfing the between-group gap. Several developing countries (Brazil, Kenya, Rwanda, Tunisia) consistently outperform their GDP predictions, while policy diffusion runs horizontally across income peers rather than trickling down from wealthy nations.

### Roadmap

- **Chapter 5** maps the global landscape of governance capacity
- **Chapter 6** examines socioeconomic and institutional determinants
- **Chapter 7** analyzes inequality patterns
- **Chapter 8** traces temporal dynamics and policy diffusion
- **Chapter 14** presents robustness checks, especially the text quality confound
- **Chapters 15-16** discuss implications and conclusions

The reality is more complicated, and more encouraging, than a simple North-South divide.
