# Preface {.unnumbered}

This project began with a fundamental question about the global proliferation of artificial intelligence policies: as governments worldwide develop AI governance frameworks at an unprecedented rate, do they possess the institutional capacity to implement them effectively?

To address this question, I assessed over 2,100 policies across more than 70 jurisdictions, evaluating five critical dimensions of implementation capacity: clarity, resources, authority, accountability, and coherence. The scoring methodology employed a three-model ensemble of large language models (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, and Gemini Flash 2.0), achieving adequate inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.83).

The findings challenge conventional assumptions about global governance capacity. While high-income countries demonstrate marginally higher capacity scores overall (Cohen's d = 0.30), this advantage disappears almost entirely when the analysis is restricted to well-documented policies (Cohen's d = 0.04). What initially appeared to be a governance capacity divide reveals itself primarily as a documentation gap. Moreover, 98% of the observed variation in capacity scores occurs within income groups rather than between them. Countries such as Brazil, Kenya, and Rwanda substantially exceed predictions based on their GDP levels, suggesting that economic development alone does not determine governance capacity. Furthermore, the analysis of policy diffusion patterns indicates that countries predominantly learn from peers at similar income levels rather than following a top-down diffusion model from wealthy nations.

This report presents the empirical evidence supporting these conclusions, along with extensive robustness checks conducted to validate the findings.
