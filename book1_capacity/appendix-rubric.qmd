## Full Indicator Rubric {#sec-appendix-rubric}

This appendix presents the scoring rubric used by the three-model LLM ensemble (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.0) to code each of the 2,216 policies. Each dimension is scored 0–4, where 0 = complete absence and 4 = comprehensive, operationally detailed articulation. The rubric was developed iteratively through literature review, pilot coding, IRR diagnostics, and validation against scoring distributions. For prompt design and aggregation rules, see @sec-scoring and @sec-appendix-validation.
