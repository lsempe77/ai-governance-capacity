## What Explains Governance Capacity? {#sec-cap-determinants}

The descriptive landscape revealed low capacity scores overall, modest income-group differences, and substantial within-group variation. This section moves from description to explanation, asking what drives variation in governance capacity across policies. Four complementary regression approaches—OLS, Tobit, quantile regression, and multilevel models—test whether national wealth, policy type, text quality, or institutional factors account for the observed patterns. The results consistently point to the same conclusion: GDP exerts a statistically significant but substantively negligible effect, while text quality and policy type emerge as the dominant predictors.

### Baseline and Multilevel Models {#sec-cap-ols}

![Scatter plot of capacity scores against log GDP per capita, with regression line. The relationship is positive but weak.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/fig_gdp_scatter.png){#fig-cap-gdp-scatter}

The scatter in @fig-cap-gdp-scatter reveals the pattern prior to formal regression: the relationship with GDP is positive but weak, with many developing-country policies exceeding the fitted line and many high-income policies falling below it. The baseline OLS model:

$$\text{Capacity}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln(\text{GDP}_{pc}) + \beta_2 \text{Year} + \beta_3 \text{Binding} + \beta_4 \text{GoodText} + \varepsilon_i$$

| Variable | $\beta$ | SE | $t$ | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| Intercept | −0.536 | 0.245 | −2.19 | .029 |
| log(GDP pc) | **0.086** | 0.023 | 3.81 | < .001 |
| Year (centred) | 0.010 | 0.006 | 1.75 | .081 |
| Binding regulation | **0.190** | 0.069 | 2.73 | .006 |
| Good text quality | **1.004** | 0.027 | 37.64 | < .001 |

: OLS regression: capacity determinants ($R^2 = 0.436$, $N = 1{,}949$) {#tbl-cap-ols}

The results reveal three patterns. **Text quality dominates all substantive predictors**: the coefficient on `is_good_text` (β = 1.004, t = 37.64) exceeds every policy-relevant variable by an order of magnitude. Policies with ≥500 words of extracted text score a full point higher on the 0–4 scale, primarily reflecting the greater evidentiary basis available to LLM coders. This represents largely a measurement artifact rather than a governance finding.

**GDP demonstrates statistical significance but substantive weakness** (β = 0.086). Tripling a country's wealth from $10K to $30K per capita raises predicted capacity by less than one-tenth of a scale point. Finally, **binding regulation adds approximately 0.19 points** (β = 0.190), reflecting the structural requirement that laws specify authorities and enforcement mechanisms.

The model's R² of 0.436 appears respectable until text quality is removed—the explained variance then collapses to 0.012. GDP, year, and document type *combined* explain only 1.2% of capacity variance. Nearly all explanatory power derives from the measurement artifact of text length.

**Multilevel models.** OLS assumes independence across observations, but policies nest within countries. Multiple policies from a single jurisdiction share institutional features, creating dependency that inflates standard errors. A random-intercept multilevel model addresses this structure:

$$\text{Capacity}_{ij} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \ln(\text{GDP}_{pc,j}) + u_j + \varepsilon_{ij}$$

where $u_j \sim N(0, \sigma^2_u)$ is the country random effect.

![Country random effects from the multilevel capacity model. Most countries cluster near zero, with a few clear over- and under-performers.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/robustness/fig_country_random_effects.png){#fig-cap-re}

| Metric | OLS | Mixed |
|:---|---:|---:|
| GDP $\beta$ | 0.088 | **0.066** |
| GDP $p$ | < .001 | .038 |
| Country ICC | — | **0.091** |
| LR test vs OLS | — | $p = .007$ |

: OLS vs. multilevel model comparison {#tbl-cap-multilevel}

The **country-level ICC of 0.091** reveals the key finding: only 9.1% of total variance occurs between countries. The remaining 90.9% represents variation between policies *within* countries. Policies from a single country differ more from each other than the average policy from that country differs from policies elsewhere.

Accounting for clustering reduces the GDP coefficient by approximately 25% (0.088 → 0.066), as OLS double-counts country-level variation. The likelihood ratio test confirms the multilevel specification is statistically preferred (p = .007), though the practical conclusion remains unchanged: GDP effects prove even smaller than OLS suggested.

### Distributional Analysis {#sec-cap-quantile}

OLS and multilevel models estimate *mean* effects. However, GDP might prove consequential for establishing basic infrastructure (lower quantiles) while remaining irrelevant for distinguishing strong from excellent policies (upper quantiles)—or the reverse. Quantile regression [@koenker1978] permits testing across the distribution.

![Quantile regression coefficients for GDP across the capacity distribution. GDP matters at the median but not at the extremes — an inverted-U pattern.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/extended/fig_quantile_regression.png){#fig-cap-qr}

@fig-cap-qr visualizes the GDP effect across quantiles, revealing a clear **inverted-U pattern** where GDP matters most at the median and least at both tails. The formal estimates quantify this heterogeneity:

| Quantile ($\tau$) | GDP $\beta$ | SE | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| 0.25 (positive subset) | 0.068 | 0.024 | .005 |
| 0.50 | **0.098** | 0.019 | < .001 |
| 0.75 | 0.064 | 0.029 | .028 |
| OLS (reference) | 0.086 | 0.023 | < .001 |

: Quantile regression: GDP effect across the capacity distribution {#tbl-cap-qr}

@fig-cap-qr shows an **inverted-U**: GDP matters most at the median (β = 0.098) and less at both tails (β = 0.064–0.068). At the bottom, many policies score zero regardless of GDP—no amount of national wealth transforms a press release into an implementation plan. At the top, excellent policies emerge from factors orthogonal to wealth: policy learning, political commitment, design sophistication. Brazil's comprehensive framework did not require first-world GDP. Wealth helps countries avoid governance failures (moving from zero to moderate) but does not ensure excellence.

**Tobit regression.** The 27.6% floor effect (scores censored at zero) biases OLS downward—scores cannot go below zero, so OLS treats observed zeros as the "true" capacity when they might reflect even lower latent quality. Tobit [@tobin1958] models this left-censoring explicitly:

$$\text{Capacity}_i^* = \mathbf{x}_i' \boldsymbol{\beta} + \varepsilon_i, \quad \text{Capacity}_i = \max(0, \text{Capacity}_i^*)$$

![Comparison of OLS and Tobit coefficients for the capacity model. Tobit coefficients are systematically larger, reflecting correction for censoring.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/extended/fig_tobit_comparison.png){#fig-cap-tobit}

| Variable | OLS $\beta$ | Tobit $\beta$ | Ratio |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| log(GDP pc) | 0.086 | **0.121** | 1.41× |
| Year | 0.010 | 0.008 | 0.80× |
| Binding regulation | 0.190 | **0.174** | 0.92× |
| Good text quality | 1.004 | **1.193** | 1.19× |
| $\sigma$ | — | 0.742 | — |

: OLS vs. Tobit comparison {#tbl-cap-tobit}

The Tobit GDP coefficient (β = 0.121) is **41% larger** than OLS (0.086), confirming that OLS understates the true wealth-capacity relationship when floor effects are present. But even corrected, 0.121 remains modest: tripling GDP per capita adds 0.12 points on a 4-point scale. The correction matters methodologically without changing the substantive conclusion.

### Synthesis {#sec-cap-determinants-synthesis}

Across four estimation strategies, three findings hold.

**Text quality dominates.** In every specification, document length dwarfs GDP, policy type, and time trends. Much of what looks like governance quality is actually documentation quality. The robustness checks in @sec-robustness test whether anything survives once measurement quality is held constant.

**GDP matters, but barely.** After multilevel correction for clustering (−25%) and Tobit correction for censoring (+41%), GDP per capita explains 3–12% of capacity variance depending on specification. Tripling national wealth adds 0.07–0.12 points on a 4-point scale. Institutional choices and policy design matter more.

**Binding regulation helps.** Laws consistently outscore voluntary guidelines by ~0.19 points, reflecting structural necessities of legal enforceability. Countries can strengthen implementation readiness by choosing binding instruments—a strategic option available regardless of wealth.

The multilevel decomposition makes the point clearly: 91% of variance is *within* countries. Seeking country-level explanations—GDP, democracy, institutional quality—inevitably leaves most variation unexplained. What matters is the individual policy: its type, how well it is documented, and what design choices it makes.
