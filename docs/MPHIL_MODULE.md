## Module Description

How do states build the capacity to govern emerging technologies? This module examines the institutional, legal, and technical foundations of digital governance, with a focus on artificial intelligence. Students learn to analyze regulatory capacity through both theoretical frameworks and hands-on data collection methods.

The module combines:
- **Theoretical foundations** from regulatory governance, state capacity, and science & technology studies
- **Empirical methods** for measuring and comparing governance capacity across jurisdictions
- **Applied skills** in data collection, indicator construction, and policy analysis
- **Policy lab** where students produce actionable capacity assessments for real-world audiences

Students will contribute to a live research project—the Global Observatory of AI Governance Capacity—giving them experience with collaborative, policy-relevant research.

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. **Analyze** theories of regulatory governance and state capacity as applied to emerging technologies
2. **Evaluate** the institutional, legal, and technical dimensions of AI governance across diverse political systems
3. **Construct** empirical indicators to measure governance capacity from primary and secondary sources
4. **Apply** mixed methods (quantitative scoring, qualitative case analysis) to compare regulatory effectiveness
5. **Produce** policy-relevant outputs (briefing notes, scorecards) for practitioner audiences
6. **Critically assess** the politics of measurement and the limitations of governance indicators
