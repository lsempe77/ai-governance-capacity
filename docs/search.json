    "text": "This research infrastructure systematically measures and compares AI governance capacity across 2,200+ jurisdictions worldwide, using the OECD.AI Policy Observatory corpus. The project addresses a central question:\n\nDo countries have the capacity to implement their AI policies, and how does this vary between high-income and developing countries?\n\nThe analysis employs three complementary lenses — implementation capacity, ethics governance depth, and UNESCO alignment — to map the global landscape of AI governance from the abstract (values) to the concrete (policy actions). The findings reveal a consistent pattern: ethical principles are widely endorsed but rarely operationalised, with accountability mechanisms the most systematically omitted governance feature worldwide."
