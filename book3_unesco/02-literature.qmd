## Theoretical Foundations {#sec-literature}

When 193 countries adopt a recommendation, several policy diffusion mechanisms may operate. The international relations literature suggests several possibilities—coercion, competition, learning, legitimacy-seeking—each implying different patterns of adoption. Understanding these mechanisms helps explain why some UNESCO components spread faster than others.

However, the norm diffusion literature confronts an identification problem: observing policy convergence does not reveal which mechanism drove it. Countries might adopt UNESCO language because they genuinely learned from multilateral deliberation (learning), because they seek international legitimacy without implementation commitment (emulation), or because major powers condition benefits on adoption (coercion). Distinguishing these mechanisms requires examining not only *whether* countries adopt UNESCO components but *how deeply* they implement them and *which* components receive priority—patterns this study traces through systematic measurement.

### The UNESCO Recommendation {#sec-lit-unesco}

The **Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence**, adopted in November 2021, established ten core values (spanning human rights to environmental sustainability) and eleven action areas (from ethical impact assessment to regulation). @taddeo2021 characterizes it as "soft law"—non-binding but influential through moral authority and coordination effects. @floridi2021 argues it provides the most comprehensive multilateral AI ethics framework to date, integrating principles from diverse philosophical traditions.

Yet comprehensiveness may come at a cost: a framework spanning 10 values and 11 action areas risks becoming unwieldy, allowing countries to claim alignment through selective adoption while neglecting components that conflict with domestic priorities. The breadth that makes UNESCO inclusive may simultaneously weaken its normative force. Moreover, soft law's influence depends on domestic actors who care about international reputation and coordination—mechanisms that may operate differently in democracies versus autocracies, or in countries deeply embedded in international institutions versus those with limited multilateral engagement. These heterogeneous responses become empirically testable through systematic alignment measurement.

### International Norm Diffusion

@simmons2006 identifies four mechanisms driving policy convergence: coercion (powerful actors impose rules), competition (regulatory arbitrage pressures jurisdictions toward common standards), learning (countries emulate successful policies from peers), and emulation (mimetic isomorphism driven by legitimacy rather than function). This study examines which mechanisms drive UNESCO alignment. If coercion or competition dominates, wealth-driven adoption patterns should emerge. If learning or emulation dominates, horizontal diffusion within regions or income groups should occur. However, Simmons and colleagues' framework was developed for economic policy domains (trade liberalization, capital account opening) where material incentives and competitive pressures are pronounced. Whether the same mechanisms operate in AI ethics—a domain characterized by normative rather than material stakes, weak enforcement mechanisms, and limited regulatory arbitrage opportunities—remains uncertain. The absence of wealth-driven adoption patterns documented in Section 18 challenges coercion and competition mechanisms, suggesting learning or legitimacy-seeking may dominate UNESCO diffusion.

**The Brussels Effect** provides a complementary lens. @bradford2020 theorizes that EU regulations become global standards through market power; in data protection, GDPR created de facto global norms as firms adopted EU standards globally rather than maintaining separate compliance systems. But AI ethics differs from data protection: no single jurisdiction dominates global AI markets sufficiently to impose standards unilaterally. UNESCO's multilateral framework thus operates through different diffusion mechanisms than GDPR, emphasizing learning and legitimacy over market coercion. Moreover, Bradford's analysis focuses on regulatory domains where firms face compliance costs that incentivize convergence. AI ethics principles impose fewer direct compliance costs—many guidelines remain aspirational without enforcement mechanisms. This reduces firms' incentives to lobby for global harmonization, potentially weakening market-driven diffusion. The selective adoption patterns documented in Section 17 support this interpretation: countries adopt UNESCO's normative vocabulary without implementing its governance requirements, suggesting legitimation rather than market-driven convergence.

### Global Standards and Local Adaptation

@acharya2004 distinguishes **localization** (modifying global norms to fit local contexts) from **transplantation** (wholesale adoption). @wiener2020 shows that international norms rarely transplant unchanged; they undergo reinterpretation reflecting local values, institutions, and priorities.

The measurement framework captures this by scoring **depth of engagement** rather than binary adoption: policies can mention UNESCO values (score 1), describe them contextually (score 2), operationalize them through requirements (score 3), or establish comprehensive governance (score 4). This approach distinguishes superficial from substantive adoption.

However, the localization literature faces a conceptual tension: if norms must adapt to local contexts to gain traction, how do we identify "the norm" being diffused? When a country mentions "human dignity" but interprets it through religious rather than rights-based frameworks, has UNESCO's human dignity value been adopted, rejected, or localized? The cluster analysis in Section 19 reveals that countries engage with UNESCO through distinct archetypes—comprehensive aligners, moderate aligners, selective aligners, and minimal engagement—suggesting that localization operates not through uniform adaptation but through divergent pathways of selective emphasis.

### Value Priorities and Selectivity

@jobin2019 documents convergence on core AI ethics principles but divergence on prioritization. @winfield2021 shows regional variation: European frameworks emphasize human rights and fundamental freedoms, Asian frameworks emphasize social harmony and collective welfare, Middle Eastern frameworks emphasize cultural values and religious principles.

UNESCO's framework accommodates this diversity through breadth, including 10 values and 11 action areas, which allows countries to prioritize different components while claiming UNESCO alignment. This study examines whether countries adopt the full framework or selectively emphasize values matching existing priorities.

Yet the convergence-with-divergence pattern creates measurement challenges: if countries adopt common principle *labels* (fairness, transparency, accountability) while diverging on operational *meanings*, does this constitute normative convergence or merely semantic convergence? The item-level analysis in Section 17 reveals that coverage rates vary dramatically across UNESCO components—some exceed 80% adoption while others fall below 10%—suggesting that countries converge on politically safe principles while avoiding components that would require substantial governance reform or challenge dominant interests.

### Implementation Challenges

@cihon2021 documents the obstacles to translating UNESCO principles into national governance: the values are vague and require national specification; 21 components create a substantial implementation burden; action areas like "ethical impact assessment" lack established templates; and multiple government agencies must coordinate on different areas.

These challenges predict variable UNESCO alignment even among committed member states. The measurement approach distinguishes rhetoric (mentioning UNESCO) from implementation (operationalizing UNESCO components).

Cihon and colleagues' analysis, however, examines implementation challenges conceptually without measuring their severity empirically. Which implementation obstacles matter most? Do coordination challenges (requiring inter-agency agreement) or specification challenges (requiring technical detail) pose greater barriers? The finding in Section 20 that post-2021 policies show only modest alignment increases despite UNESCO providing a detailed framework suggests specification challenges may be less constraining than political economy factors—countries may understand *how* to implement UNESCO but lack *incentives* to do so without enforcement mechanisms or domestic constituencies demanding compliance.

### Research Questions and Contribution

This literature motivates three research questions: How aligned are national policies with UNESCO's 21-component framework? Which values and action areas receive priority, and which are neglected? Has alignment increased since 2021?

These questions address a broader theoretical puzzle: under what conditions do international normative instruments influence domestic governance? The UNESCO case provides analytical leverage because its 2021 adoption creates a temporal discontinuity, its comprehensive framework enables component-level analysis, and its global participation permits cross-national comparison. If soft law influences governance, we should observe post-2021 alignment increases, priority given to enforcement-backed components, and adoption concentrated among countries embedded in multilateral institutions. The empirical patterns test these expectations.

**Contribution.** This study addresses three gaps in the norm diffusion literature. **First**, while scholars have theorized soft law influence mechanisms, systematic measurement of soft law adoption patterns across large samples remains rare. This study scores UNESCO alignment across 2,100+ policies, enabling statistical analysis of adoption determinants and temporal dynamics. **Second**, the localization literature emphasizes how norms adapt to local contexts, yet provides limited evidence on *which* norm components undergo localization versus transplantation. The component-level analysis distinguishes broadly adopted versus selectively emphasized UNESCO items, revealing that countries converge on abstract values while diverging on operational requirements. **Third**, existing studies examine whether international instruments influence domestic policy without testing whether influence operates through changed discourse or changed governance structures. The depth-based scoring approach distinguishes mention from operationalization, showing that UNESCO changed what policies *discuss* substantially more than what they *implement*.

The findings challenge optimistic accounts of soft law influence: the post-2021 alignment increase, while statistically significant, leaves policies below the operationalization threshold; selective adoption patterns suggest legitimation rather than genuine normative internalization; and the absence of wealth effects indicates that UNESCO diffuses through horizontal emulation rather than through capacity-building or coercion. These patterns are consistent with "decoupling"—countries adopt international norms symbolically while maintaining existing governance arrangements.
