## How Robust Are UNESCO Findings? {#sec-robustness}

The main findings survive stress-testing: the post-2021 alignment increase is robust, the two-cluster typology is stable, and text quality confounds are limited.

### Post-2021 Adoption Effect {#sec-post-unesco}

The UNESCO Recommendation was adopted in November 2021. The analysis examines whether policies created after adoption demonstrate stronger alignment.

| Period | N | Mean UNESCO Score | Interpretation |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| Pre-2021 (2017-2021) | 1,342 | 1.52 | Baseline |
| **Post-2021 (2022-2025)** | 755 | **1.84** | **+21% increase** |
| Difference | — | +0.32*** | $p$ < .001 |

: UNESCO alignment before and after Recommendation {#tbl-unesco-temporal}

Policies demonstrate substantially stronger alignment. The +0.32 point gain (21% from baseline) is statistically significant and substantively meaningful. The Recommendation influenced national policy development.

However, even post-2021 policies score only 1.84—between “mentioned” and “described,” well short of “operationalized.” UNESCO changed what policies *discuss* more than what they *implement*.

**Component-level analysis.** Which components drove the increase?

The gains concentrate in core governance: human rights (+18%), transparency (+15%), accountability (+16%), governance mechanisms (+18%), regulation (+17%), ethical impact assessment (+23%).

The laggards remain laggards: environmental sustainability (+3%), gender (+4%), culture (+4%). Selective adoption persists even after UNESCO provided a comprehensive framework.

### Cluster Stability

The two-cluster solution ("Comprehensive Alignment" 28% vs "Selective Adoption" 72%) is stable:

| $k$ | Silhouette Score |
|:---|---:|
| 2 | **0.44** (optimal) |
| 3 | 0.36 |
| 4 | 0.31 |
| 5 | 0.27 |

: UNESCO cluster stability {#tbl-unesco-clusters}

Silhouette scores peak at k=2 and decline monotonically, confirming the binary typology. Even within the "Comprehensive Alignment" cluster, the mean score (2.34/4.0) indicates "described" rather than "operationalized" engagement; rhetoric exceeds implementation.

### Text Quality Effects on UNESCO {#sec-text-quality}

Does the text quality confound affect UNESCO alignment?

| Sample | N | Mean UNESCO | Difference |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| All texts | 2,097 | 1.68 | Baseline |
| Good-text (≥500 words) | 948 | 1.87 | +11% |

: UNESCO scores by text quality {#tbl-unesco-text}

UNESCO alignment shows modest sensitivity to text quality (+11% for well-documented policies) compared to capacity (87% gap reduction) or ethics (sign reversal). This suggests UNESCO measurement is more robust to documentation quality, possibly because UNESCO's 21 components are mentioned even in brief summaries, while capacity infrastructure and ethics operationalization require detailed text to detect.

On income-group UNESCO gaps: full sample d = +0.18***; good-text d = +0.11 ($p$ = .06). Unlike capacity/ethics (where gaps vanish), the UNESCO gap merely shrinks, remaining marginally significant. This persistence suggests genuine alignment differences rather than pure measurement artifacts.

### Sensitivity Analyses and Summary

**Regional robustness**: The post-2021 alignment increases are consistent across all regions (Africa +23%, Europe +19%, Americas +21%, Asia +18%), confirming that the temporal pattern is not driven by any single geographic bloc. African countries show the largest gains, consistent with the finding that UNESCO serves as a governance template in regions building AI frameworks from scratch.

**Component robustness**: All 21 UNESCO components show positive post-2021 trends, though magnitudes range from +3% (environment, gender) to +23% (ethical impact assessment). The concentration of gains in core governance components, with cross-cutting themes lagging, is consistent across all analytical specifications.

**Temporal specification**: Results hold across alternative period definitions: pre/post November 2021 (the formal adoption date), calendar year splits (pre/post January 2022), and announcement versus adoption date distinctions. The +21% gain is not sensitive to exactly where the temporal boundary is drawn.

**A note on metrics.** This book uses two distinct UNESCO-related metrics. The **10-dimension capacity/ethics composite** (0–4 scale) measures general governance quality using the C1–C5 and E1–E5 framework shared across all three companion studies; on this metric, post-2021 policies score higher (1.52 → 1.84, +21%). The **25-item UNESCO alignment score** (0–100 scale) measures specific coverage of and depth on UNESCO’s own framework; on this metric, mean alignment is slightly *lower* post-2021 (54.6 → 53.0). The discrepancy is interpretable: post-2021 policies engage more deeply with core governance principles (captured by the C+E composite) while the expanding policy corpus includes narrower instruments that address fewer of UNESCO’s 25 specific items (captured by the alignment score). Both metrics are valid; they measure different things.

**Summary.** @tbl-unesco-robustness consolidates the robustness findings.

| Finding | Robust? | Evidence |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Post-2021 alignment increase | ✅ **Yes** | +21%, consistent across regions/components |
| Two-cluster structure | ✅ Yes | Stable across k values |
| Selective adoption pattern | ✅ Yes | Core governance emphasized, cross-cutting themes neglected |
| Implementation gap | ✅ Yes | Even high-alignment policies below "operationalized" |
| Text quality sensitivity | ⚠️ Moderate | +11% for good texts (less than capacity/ethics) |

: UNESCO robustness summary {#tbl-unesco-robustness}

UNESCO findings are highly robust: the post-2021 alignment increase, selective adoption pattern, and implementation gap persist across specifications. Unlike capacity/ethics, UNESCO alignment shows genuine income-group differences that don't entirely vanish with text quality controls, suggesting wealthy countries engage more comprehensively with the multilateral framework.
