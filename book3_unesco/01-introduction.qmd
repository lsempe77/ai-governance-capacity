## Global Alignment with UNESCO AI Ethics {#sec-intro}

In November 2021, 193 countries adopted a shared vision for ethical AI. This study examines whether countries translated this international commitment into national policy.

### The UNESCO Milestone

The **Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence**, adopted in November 2021, stands as the first global normative instrument on AI ethics. It is ambitious in scope: ten core values (from human rights to environmental sustainability) and eleven action areas (spanning ethical impact assessment to gender policy). No previous multilateral agreement had attempted anything this comprehensive for AI governance. This study examines the extent to which countries have translated this ambition into national policies.

### Research Questions

This study addresses three research questions: How closely do national AI policies align with UNESCO's framework? Which values receive priority and which are neglected? Has the Recommendation influenced policy development since 2021?

### Measurement Framework

We score each policy on 21 UNESCO components (10 values + 11 action areas) using the same LLM ensemble methodology achieving ICC = 0.827. Scores reflect depth of engagement: 0 = absent, 1 = mentioned, 2 = described, 3 = operationalized, 4 = comprehensive.

The short answer: partial adoption. Mean alignment sits at 1.68 out of 4.0—somewhere between "mentioned" and "described" but well short of "operationalized." Countries cherry-pick. Human rights and transparency score highest (1.92 and 1.85); environmental sustainability trails at 1.28. Only 28% of policies show comprehensive alignment; the remaining 72% engage selectively. Post-2021 policies do show stronger alignment, though the improvement is modest rather than transformative.

The remainder of this book proceeds as follows. @sec-unesco-landscape maps the alignment landscape—which UNESCO components countries address and how deeply. @sec-unesco-determinants investigates what drives alignment, revealing that national wealth is not a significant determinant. @sec-unesco-clusters identifies four distinct policy archetypes through cluster analysis. @sec-unesco-dynamics examines whether the 2021 adoption date actually changed anything. @sec-robustness stress-tests our findings, and @sec-discussion and @sec-conclusion draw out the implications.
