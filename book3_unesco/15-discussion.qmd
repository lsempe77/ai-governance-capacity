## Implications for UNESCO Alignment {#sec-discussion}

The empirical analysis has established that UNESCO alignment is partial and selective: countries adopt components matching existing priorities while neglecting environmental sustainability, gender, and culture. The post-2021 adoption produced measurable but modest change, and national wealth is effectively irrelevant as a predictor. This section draws out the implications for theory, policy, and research.

### Selective Adoption and Normative Decoupling

Mean alignment of 1.68 out of 4.0 indicates that most policies fall between "mentioned" and "described"—far short of genuine operationalisation. The pattern is one of **normative decoupling**, consistent with @acharya2004's distinction between localisation and transplantation, and with the broader institutionalist literature on symbolic compliance. Countries invoke UNESCO to validate existing priorities rather than to reshape their governance frameworks.

The selectivity is revealing. Policies emphasise human rights (1.92), transparency (1.85), and accountability (1.78)—precisely the components that align with pre-existing governance traditions and impose minimal additional obligations. Environmental sustainability (1.28), gender (1.45), and culture (1.41) lag because they require governments to address cross-cutting issues that fall outside the traditional regulatory perimeter of AI policy. This pattern is consistent with @simmons2006's observation that norm adoption is easiest when it reinforces existing domestic arrangements and most difficult when it requires institutional innovation.

The decoupling hypothesis receives further support from the depth analysis: coverage does not predict depth ($r = 0.02$, $p = 0.94$). The most frequently invoked principles appear as rhetorical gestures rather than developed commitments. @taddeo2021's characterisation of the UNESCO Recommendation as "soft law" implies precisely this risk: without binding obligations, countries can claim alignment without implementation, producing what international relations scholars call "organised hypocrisy" — the systematic gap between what states declare internationally and what they practise domestically.

### The Political Economy of Neglected Components

The near-absence of gender (9.6%), culture (9.1%), and communication & information (2.0%) from the global policy landscape reflects political economy rather than oversight. **Gender-responsive AI governance** requires governments to acknowledge and address algorithmic bias, gendered data gaps, and the differential impacts of automation on women's employment—issues that create regulatory costs and may conflict with industry preferences for minimal governance. **Cultural considerations** require engagement with indigenous knowledge systems, linguistic diversity, and the rights of cultural minorities—domains where AI governance intersects with politically sensitive identity politics. **Communication and information** addresses AI's impact on media, disinformation, and freedom of expression—a domain where governments may resist governance constraints on their own information management capabilities.

The 22.9% coverage of **human rights and human dignity** is perhaps the most telling finding. For a framework that explicitly grounds AI ethics in human rights, this omission reveals the distance between UNESCO's normative vision (rights-based governance) and the prevailing governance paradigm (technology-centric regulation). Most countries approach AI governance as a question of technology management rather than rights protection, consistent with @bradford2020's observation that regulatory frameworks tend to reflect the interests of regulated industries rather than affected populations.

### Post-2021 Change and Diffusion Mechanisms

The 21% increase in alignment scores after 2021 demonstrates that the UNESCO Recommendation influenced national policy discourse. But even post-2021 policies average only 1.84—still below the operationalisation threshold. The Recommendation changed what policies *discuss* substantially more than what they *implement*, consistent with @floridi2021's warning that comprehensive normative frameworks risk becoming aspirational documents without enforcement mechanisms.

This raises a structural question about soft law effectiveness. @cihon2021 documented the implementation obstacles: vague values requiring national specification, 21 components creating a substantial burden, missing operational templates, and coordination challenges across agencies. The data suggest that specification challenges are less constraining than incentive problems—countries understand *what* UNESCO asks but lack domestic constituencies demanding compliance and enforcement mechanisms penalising non-compliance. The finding that the post-2021 gains concentrate in core governance (human rights +18%, transparency +15%) while cross-cutting themes stagnate (environment +3%, gender +4%) supports this interpretation: countries adopt the easy components and avoid those requiring genuine institutional reform.

**Regional patterns and diffusion mechanisms.** African countries showing the highest UNESCO alignment (1.78) is consistent with @acharya2004's prediction that new governance frameworks gain most traction where existing governance traditions are thinnest. African countries building AI governance from scratch—without entrenched regulatory frameworks or powerful domestic industries resisting governance constraints—more readily adopt UNESCO as a comprehensive template. European countries (1.72), by contrast, selectively incorporate UNESCO elements into established regulatory architectures (GDPR, the EU AI Act), treating UNESCO as a supplement rather than a foundation. This distinction—UNESCO as template versus UNESCO as supplement—helps explain the regional variation documented in @sec-unesco-region.

Five limitations qualify these findings. **First**, the alignment measurement captures *substantive overlap* with UNESCO components rather than *intentional implementation*. A policy scoring high on "transparency" may reflect domestic governance traditions rather than UNESCO influence. The pre/post comparison mitigates this concern but cannot establish causality. **Second**, the OECD.AI Observatory was not designed to track UNESCO compliance, and its coverage may miss policies that explicitly implement the Recommendation but are not catalogued in the database. **Third**, the LLM scoring models may not distinguish between genuine engagement with UNESCO principles and superficial adoption of UNESCO vocabulary without substantive commitment. **Fourth**, the 25-item alignment score and the 10-dimension capacity/ethics score capture different aspects of governance quality; discrepancies between them (addressed in @sec-robustness) reflect measurement scope rather than error but may confuse readers comparing across chapters. **Fifth**, the cross-sectional design cannot establish whether the post-2021 increase reflects UNESCO influence, broader governance maturation, or compositional changes in the policy corpus (new entrant countries, different policy types). The temporal analyses in @sec-unesco-dynamics address this partially but cannot provide definitive causal attribution.
