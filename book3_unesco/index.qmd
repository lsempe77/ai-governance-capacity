# Preface {.unnumbered}

In November 2021, UNESCO achieved a multilateral milestone: 193 countries adopted a shared framework for AI ethics. This study examines subsequent policy implementation.

This study analyzed 2,100+ AI policies from 70+ jurisdictions to measure the extent to which national governance aligns with UNESCO's ten core values and eleven action areas. The analysis reveals partial adoption. Countries selectively emphasize components that match existing priorities while largely neglecting environmental sustainability, gender, and culture.

## What We Found

Mean alignment sits at 1.68 out of 4.0—somewhere between "mentioned" and "described," well short of operationalized. Human rights and transparency score highest; sustainability trails far behind. Only 28% of policies show comprehensive alignment; the remaining 72% adopt selectively. Post-2021 policies show modest improvement, but the 2021 milestone changed rhetoric more than practice.

## How We Measured It

The study employed three large language models (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.0) as automated policy analysts, scoring each document against UNESCO's 21 components. The ensemble achieves excellent reliability (ICC = 0.827)—comparable to human expert agreement on complex policy assessment tasks.
