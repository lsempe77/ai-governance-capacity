# Preface {.unnumbered}

In November 2021, UNESCO achieved something rare: 193 countries agreed on a shared framework for AI ethics. This book asks what happened next.

We analyzed 2,100+ AI policies from 70+ jurisdictions to measure how closely national governance actually aligns with UNESCO's ten core values and eleven action areas. The short answer: partial adoption. Countries cherry-pick the components that match existing priorities while largely ignoring environmental sustainability, gender, and culture.

## What We Found

Mean alignment sits at 1.68 out of 4.0—somewhere between "mentioned" and "described," well short of operationalized. Human rights and transparency score highest; sustainability trails far behind. Only 28% of policies show comprehensive alignment; the remaining 72% adopt selectively. Post-2021 policies show modest improvement, but the 2021 milestone changed rhetoric more than practice.

## How We Measured It

We used three large language models (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.0) as automated policy analysts, scoring each document against UNESCO's 21 components. The ensemble achieves excellent reliability (ICC = 0.827)—comparable to human expert agreement on complex policy assessment tasks.
