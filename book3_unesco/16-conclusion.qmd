## UNESCO as Coordination Framework {#sec-conclusion}

The UNESCO Recommendation partially reshaped global AI governance. Countries adopted its language more than its substance, aligning selectively with components that matched their existing priorities while largely neglecting environmental sustainability, gender, and cultural considerations.

### Main Findings

**Selective adoption dominates.** Mean alignment sits at 1.68 out of 4.0—between "mentioned" and "described," well short of operationalised. Only 28% of policies show comprehensive alignment; the remaining 72% engage selectively, emphasising human rights, transparency, and accountability while neglecting gender (9.6%), culture (9.1%), and communication (2.0%). This pattern is consistent with normative decoupling: countries claim alignment to gain international legitimacy without restructuring domestic governance.

**The post-2021 increase is real but modest.** Policies adopted after November 2021 score 21% higher on the 10-dimension capacity/ethics composite, and the 25-item UNESCO alignment score shows gains in diversity (+9.4pp) and fairness (+8.2pp). However, even post-2021 policies remain below the operationalisation threshold. The Recommendation changed what policies *discuss* substantially more than what they *implement*.

**National wealth is irrelevant.** The income-group gap is effectively zero (d = 0.001). UNESCO alignment reflects policy design choices, not national wealth. African countries show the highest alignment (1.78), adopting UNESCO as a governance template where domestic AI governance traditions are thinnest.

**Four governance archetypes** characterise the global landscape: comprehensive aligners (values-based, whole-of-government), moderate aligners (regulatory-technical, EU-influenced), selective aligners (technocratic-safety), and minimal engagement (sectoral or early-stage). Income composition is nearly identical across all four clusters.

### Future Research and Looking Forward

The pre/post 2021 comparison provides suggestive but not definitive evidence of UNESCO influence. Three alternative explanations remain plausible: broader governance maturation that would have occurred regardless of UNESCO, compositional changes in the policy corpus (new entrant countries issuing preliminary documents), and the contemporaneous influence of other normative instruments (the EU AI Act's drafting process, national AI strategy cycles). Establishing causal attribution would require quasi-experimental designs exploiting exogenous variation in UNESCO exposure—for example, comparing countries that participated in the drafting process versus late signatories, or exploiting regional variation in UNESCO institutional presence.

Several directions warrant investigation. **First**, tracking whether alignment deepens over time—whether countries that initially mention UNESCO components subsequently operationalise them—would test whether soft law influence operates through a slow-diffusion mechanism that cross-sectional analysis underestimates. **Second**, pairing alignment scores with implementation indicators (whether countries actually established the ethical impact assessments, gender policies, or environmental monitoring that UNESCO calls for) would bridge the gap between policy text and governance reality. **Third**, examining whether UNESCO alignment predicts substantive governance outcomes—citizen trust, algorithmic fairness, rights protection—would test whether the framework matters beyond discourse. **Fourth**, the 21-component structure enables fine-grained analysis of norm diffusion: which components spread fastest, through what channels, and whether early adoption of one component predicts subsequent adoption of others. **Fifth**, comparative analysis with other soft law instruments (the OECD AI Principles, the G7 Hiroshima Process) would test whether UNESCO's influence patterns are distinctive or reflect generic features of international normative diffusion.

**Looking forward.** Transforming rhetoric into implementation would require accountability mechanisms that UNESCO currently lacks: annual member-state reporting on alignment progress, regional peer review forums where countries compare operationalisation strategies, technical assistance for translating the 21 components into national legislation and institutional arrangements, and visible recognition for countries that move beyond lip service. Whether the political will exists for such measures—given UNESCO's consensus-based governance and the sensitivity of monitoring member-state compliance—is another question entirely.

This analysis is a snapshot. The research infrastructure—the scraping pipeline, text extraction tools, LLM scoring framework, and analytical code—supports continuous tracking that would produce member-state scorecards benchmarked against UNESCO's 21 components, identify operationalisation gaps where technical assistance is most needed, track whether the neglected components (gender, culture, environment) receive increased attention over time, and provide evidence-based input for UNESCO's own monitoring and reporting processes.

*Alignment is neither automatic nor impossible. It requires political commitment—and political commitment requires domestic constituencies that care about international norms. Building those constituencies may be UNESCO's most important, and most difficult, task.*
