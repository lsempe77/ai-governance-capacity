## Convergence, Diffusion, and the Ethics Frontier {#sec-eth-dynamics}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** In contrast to capacity, ethics scores are converging across income groups—though through an unexpected mechanism: high-income countries are declining rather than developing countries improving. The efficiency frontier for ethics features several African countries exceeding GDP-based predictions.

### The Convergence Finding {#sec-eth-convergence}

Capacity showed stable gaps from 2017-2025. Ethics diverges: gaps are narrowing.

@fig-eth-convergence shows high-income countries declining while developing countries remain flat. @fig-eth-dim-convergence shows the decline affects multiple dimensions.

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Income × Year interaction | $\beta = -0.031$, $p = .015$* |
| HI temporal slope | −0.023/yr ($p = .001$) |
| Developing temporal slope | +0.016/yr (n.s.) |
| Gap trend | Narrowing (−0.038/yr, $p = .018$) |

: Convergence test for ethics scores {#tbl-eth-convergence}

Ethics gaps narrow at −0.031 points per year (p = .015). The mechanism is unexpected: high-income countries decline at −0.023/yr (p = .001), while developing countries show modest, non-significant improvement (+0.016/yr). The gap narrows because wealthy countries retreat rather than developing countries catching up.

Why are high-income countries declining?

1. *Regulation replacing aspiration:* Early policies (2017-2020) were deliberative frameworks—Canada's Declaration, France's Villani Report. Later policies (EU AI Act) focus on compliance, assuming ethics as background. This represents maturation rather than regression.

2. *Ethics fatigue:* Initial enthusiasm waned as AI governance became routine. Newer policies address technical issues where ethics may seem tangential.

3. *Composition effects:* Later policies are narrower (AI procurement in healthcare) rather than comprehensive frameworks.

4. *Industry pressure:* Some countries de-emphasize ethics amid arguments that requirements stifle competitiveness.

Developing countries show modest improvement (+0.016/yr), though below significance — indicating heterogeneity consistent with 99.5% within-group variation. If trends continue, the gap closes entirely by 2030. Ethics diffuses more readily than capacity, requiring political will rather than fiscal resources.

### Temporal Trends {#sec-eth-temporal-trends}

Not all dimensions decline equally; specific dimensions drive the trend.

![Ethics dimension scores over time.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_temporal_dimensions.png){#fig-eth-temporal-dims}

![Ethics trends by income group.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_temporal_income.png){#fig-eth-temporal-income}

@fig-eth-temporal-dims shows E1 Framework Depth and E3 Governance Mechanisms decline sharpest, while E2 Rights Protection and E5 Inclusion remain stable. This supports the "regulation replacing aspiration" interpretation: newer policies assume rights as established principles while focusing on implementation details rather than comprehensive frameworks.

@fig-eth-temporal-income confirms convergence visually: high-income trajectories trend down, developing countries stay flat, and the gap narrows.

### Policy Diffusion {#sec-eth-diffusion}

Capacity showed 98% horizontal diffusion (peer learning) rather than vertical (rich-to-poor). Ethics exhibits a similar pattern.

![Cumulative adoption curves for ethics governance.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/fig_diffusion_curves.png){#fig-eth-diffusion}

![First movers in AI ethics governance.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/fig_first_movers.png){#fig-eth-first-movers}

![Regional diffusion heatmap for ethics policies.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/fig_diffusion_heatmap.png){#fig-eth-diffusion-heatmap}

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| HI median first adoption | 2018 |
| Developing median first adoption | 2020 |
| Adoption lag (HI earlier by) | 1.2 years ($p = .021$) |
| HI adoption by 2025 | 100% |
| Developing adoption by 2025 | 72% |
| Diffusion direction | 98% horizontal |

: Ethics diffusion patterns {#tbl-eth-diffusion}

The adoption gap exceeds the quality gap: high-income countries adopted 1.2 years earlier and achieved 100% adoption by 2025 vs. 72% for developing countries. Quality differences are smaller for ethics (d=0.20) than capacity (d=0.30).

Twenty-eight percent of developing countries have no ethics content—complete governance voids without principles, rights protections, or accountability mechanisms. This coverage gap matters more than quality gaps.

Despite this, diffusion is 98% horizontal—developing countries learn from regional peers rather than wealthy countries. International frameworks (UNESCO AI Ethics Recommendation) establish foundations, but countries adapt ethics to local contexts from similar jurisdictions.

### Efficiency Frontier {#sec-eth-frontier}

Capacity analysis showed GDP explains only 3.5% of variation. For ethics, it's even less.

![Ethics efficiency frontier. GDP explains only 1.5% of country-level ethics variation.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/fig_efficiency_frontier.png){#fig-eth-frontier}

![Residual ranking for ethics: distance from GDP-predicted score.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/fig_residual_ranking.png){#fig-eth-residual}

![Over- and under-performer profiles for ethics.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/fig_overunder_profile.png){#fig-eth-overunder}

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| OLS $R^2$ (score ~ GDP) | 0.015 |
| Top overperformer | 🇮🇸 Iceland (+0.61) |
| Top underperformer | 🇰🇿 Kazakhstan (−0.56) |
| Frontier countries (FDH) | Uganda → Rwanda → Nigeria → Brazil → Iceland |
| Most efficient (score/$10k GDP) | Rwanda (2.30), Nigeria (1.51) |

: Ethics efficiency frontier results {#tbl-eth-frontier}

GDP explains just 1.5% of ethics variation (R² = 0.015). Knowing GDP tells you almost nothing about ethics quality.

The frontier features developing countries alongside wealthy ones: Uganda, Rwanda, Nigeria, and Brazil all achieve near-maximum ethics at their GDP levels. Rwanda's efficiency ratio of 2.30 ethics points per $10,000 GDP is four times the typical high-income ratio. These countries demonstrate that ethics emerges from political commitment rather than fiscal abundance.

Kazakhstan underperforms most dramatically (−0.56 residual), with resource wealth failing to generate ethics governance. Several wealthy Asian countries similarly emphasize competitiveness over ethics.

Diverse pathways work: Iceland's deliberative democracy, Nigeria's federal civil society engagement, Brazil's multi-stakeholder processes. No single institutional model monopolizes ethical AI governance.

### Chapter Summary

Three patterns distinguish ethics dynamics from capacity. First, convergence occurs via decline: high-income countries decline at −0.023/yr (p = .001) while developing countries improve modestly. The gap narrows because wealthy countries shift from aspirational frameworks to technical regulation. Second, adoption gaps exceed quality gaps: only 72% of developing countries have any ethics policy (vs. 100% HI). Quality differences are small (d = 0.20), but 28% of developing countries have complete ethics voids. Third, GDP explains almost nothing (R² = 0.015). Rwanda achieves 2.30 ethics points per $10,000 GDP. Political commitment matters; wealth does not.

These findings suggest ethics governance is achievable at any income level. Development interventions should target coverage gaps and facilitate South-South learning from frontier countries like Rwanda, Kenya, and Brazil.
