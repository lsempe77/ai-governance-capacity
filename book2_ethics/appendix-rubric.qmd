## Full Indicator Rubric {#sec-appendix-rubric}

This appendix presents the complete scoring rubric used by the three-model LLM ensemble (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.0) to code each of the 2,216 policies in the corpus. The rubric operationalises the ICE (Implementation Capacity-Equity) framework described in @sec-literature and @sec-scoring, translating the ten conceptual dimensions into concrete scoring criteria that enable systematic cross-policy comparison. Each dimension is scored on a 0–4 ordinal scale, where 0 represents complete absence of the dimension and 4 represents comprehensive, operationally detailed articulation. The rubric design prioritises inter-rater reliability while preserving the substantive distinctions that matter for governance quality assessment.

The rubric was developed through an iterative process involving: (1) literature review of implementation theory and AI governance frameworks, (2) manual coding of a pilot sample to identify salient distinctions, (3) refinement based on inter-rater reliability diagnostics from the LLM ensemble, and (4) validation against the scoring distributions reported in @sec-eth-landscape. The version presented here is the final rubric used for the full corpus analysis. For methodological details on LLM prompt design, temperature settings, and aggregation rules, see @sec-scoring and @sec-appendix-validation.
