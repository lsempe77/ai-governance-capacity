## Implications for Ethics Governance {#sec-discussion}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** This chapter examines implications of the ethics findings, focusing on the relationship between wealth and normative governance, convergence patterns, and the operationalization challenge.

### Ethics and Economic Development

GDP shows no effect on ethics scores at any quantile. Unlike implementation capacity (where GDP matters modestly), ethics governance requires political commitment rather than fiscal resources.

Nearly 97% of policies score below 2.0 on operationalization. This deficit affects high-income and developing countries alike—a universal weakness rather than a development-stage phenomenon.

Countries at any income level can strengthen ethics governance immediately. Economic development is not a prerequisite.

### Convergence Over Time

Ethics gaps are narrowing, in contrast to the stable capacity gaps documented earlier. High-income scores dropped from 1.58 (2017-2020) to 1.34 (2021-2025), while developing-country scores remained stable.

Wealthy countries' early ethics frameworks tended toward aspiration over implementation. Developing countries, learning from these experiences, have emphasized operationalization from the outset—avoiding the principle-heavy, implementation-light approach that characterized first-generation frameworks.

### The Operationalization Challenge

E4 Operationalization scores lowest among ethics dimensions (mean 0.91). Policies invoke principles without specifying compliance requirements, enforcement procedures, or technical standards. What @selbst2019 termed "fairness gerrymandering"—proclaiming commitments without operational definitions—characterizes much of global ethics governance.

Addressing this gap requires specifying operational definitions (what does fairness mean in public procurement?), establishing compliance procedures, creating enforcement mechanisms, and providing technical guidance.

### Documentation Quality as Confounder

The income gap (d=0.20) reverses direction for well-documented policies (d=-0.09, n.s.). When documentation quality is comparable, developing countries slightly outperform wealthy countries.

The apparent gap in the full sample reflects measurement artifacts rather than genuine differences in normative governance. Future ethics research should control for documentation quality to avoid similar confounds.

### Within-Group Variation

Nearly all ethics variation (99%) occurs within income groups rather than between them. Countries at similar GDP levels show vastly different ethics depth—political choices, not economic constraints, drive the distribution.

Tunisia, Brazil, and Canada anchor the ethics efficiency frontier, while several wealthy countries underperform relative to their economic resources.

These patterns suggest ethics governance is actionable at any income level. Countries can strengthen commitments through legislative specificity, rights codification, participatory mechanisms, and inclusion mandates.
