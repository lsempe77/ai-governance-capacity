## The Global Landscape of AI Ethics Governance {#sec-eth-landscape}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** This chapter mirrors the capacity landscape analysis for the five ethics dimensions. Ethics governance lags behind implementation capacity (mean 0.61 vs. 0.83), and 36.3% of all policies score exactly zero on ethics operationalisation.

### Overall Score Distribution {#sec-eth-distribution}

Policies worldwide score substantially weaker on ethics than on implementation capacity. Capacity averages 0.83 across the 2,216-policy corpus; ethics averages just 0.61 — a gap of 0.22 points. Policymakers find it easier to specify budgets, agencies, and coordination procedures than to articulate ethical commitments. The floor effects in @fig-eth-distributions are more severe than for capacity: many policies contain zero ethical content despite explicitly addressing AI governance.

The right-skewed distribution shows that the modal policy contains almost no ethical content, while a minority demonstrates sophisticated ethics governance. Technical implementation dominates; ethical principles remain aspirational.

![Distribution of ethics dimension scores across 2,216 policies. Floor effects are even more pronounced than for capacity.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_distributions.png){#fig-eth-distributions}

The ethics composite score averages 0.61/4.00 (SD = 0.62), substantially lower than the capacity composite (0.83):

| Dimension | Mean | SD | Median |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| E1 Ethical Framework Depth | 0.67 | 0.75 | 0.00 |
| E2 Rights Protection | 0.55 | 0.66 | 0.00 |
| E3 Governance Mechanisms | 0.62 | 0.74 | 0.00 |
| E4 Operationalisation | 0.59 | 0.73 | 0.00 |
| E5 Inclusion & Participation | 0.65 | 0.73 | 0.00 |
| **Ethics composite** | **0.61** | **0.62** | **0.40** |

: Ethics dimension descriptive statistics {#tbl-eth-descriptives}

@tbl-eth-descriptives shows key patterns. The median score of 0.40 falls well below the 2.00 scale midpoint—more than half of policies demonstrate minimal ethical engagement. Compare this to capacity's median of 0.60. More strikingly, 36.3% of policies score exactly zero on ethics (vs. 27.6% for capacity). Over one-third of the corpus contains no rights protections, no stakeholder inclusion, no governance frameworks.

Why such pervasive floor effects? Three possibilities: (1) many policies address narrow technical issues where drafters consider ethics irrelevant; (2) policymakers deliberately avoid ethical commitments that constrain development or create enforcement burdens; (3) developing ethical frameworks requires expertise, consultation, and political consensus that many jurisdictions lack.

Dimension-level means show little variation (0.55 to 0.67), unlike capacity where Resources (1.15) and Accountability (0.52) diverge sharply. Ethics governance is uniformly weak. E2 Rights Protection scores lowest (0.55)—fundamental human rights protections remain absent from many policies. E1 Ethical Framework Depth scores highest (0.67) but still below the midpoint; policies citing ethical principles rarely develop them beyond superficial invocations.

Countries prove better at specifying *how* to implement governance than *what ethical standards* to govern by. Without ethical foundations, sophisticated implementation infrastructure may serve technocratic efficiency rather than rights protection.

### Income-Group Comparisons {#sec-eth-income}

The capacity gap between high-income and developing countries was modest (d = 0.30). For ethics, the gap is smaller still. While capacity requires budgets and technical expertise that wealth provides, ethical governance requires political will and normative clarity—factors unrelated to GDP.

These patterns run counter to narratives positioning ethics as a "luxury" achievable only after economic growth. Rights protections, stakeholder inclusion, and ethical operationalization are no harder for lower-income countries than for wealthy ones. Developing countries may even hold advantages: fewer entrenched corporate interests resisting governance constraints.

![Violin plots of ethics scores by income group. The distributions overlap even more than for capacity.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_income_violins.png){#fig-eth-income-violins}

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| HI mean (N = 1,700) | 0.62 |
| Developing mean (N = 397) | 0.50 |
| Welch's $t$ | 3.55 |
| $p$-value | < .001 |
| Cohen's $d$ | **0.20** |

: Income-group ethics comparison {#tbl-eth-income}

@tbl-eth-income quantifies what @fig-eth-income-violins shows: the ethics gap is small. Cohen's d = 0.20 falls within the "small effect" threshold (d < 0.30), smaller than capacity's d = 0.30. High-income countries average 0.62 versus 0.50 for developing countries — just 0.12 points on a 4-point scale, about 3% of the range.

This gap vanishes entirely when restricting to good-quality texts (d = -0.09, n.s.; see @sec-robustness). The apparent income advantage reflects documentation quality rather than genuine governance differences. Wealthy countries produce longer documents that provide more opportunities to detect ethical content; conditional on text quality, ethical sophistication is unrelated to GDP.

Ethics governance thus requires neither fiscal resources nor technical infrastructure. Countries can build rights-protective, participatory governance frameworks immediately.

#### Dimension-Level Gaps

![Boxplots of ethics scores by income group across all five dimensions.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_income_boxplot.png){#fig-eth-income-boxplot}

| Dimension | HI Mean | Dev Mean | Diff | $d$ | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| E1 Framework | 0.68 | 0.58 | 0.10 | 0.13 | .024 |
| E2 Rights | 0.55 | 0.47 | 0.08 | 0.11 | .053 |
| E3 Governance | 0.63 | 0.50 | 0.13 | **0.19** | < .001 |
| E4 Operationalisation | 0.61 | 0.43 | 0.17 | **0.25** | < .001 |
| E5 Inclusion | 0.64 | 0.51 | 0.13 | 0.18 | .002 |

: Dimension-level income gaps for ethics {#tbl-eth-dim-gaps}

@tbl-eth-dim-gaps disaggregates the ethics gap by dimension. The largest gap appears on Operationalisation (E4) (d = 0.25, p < .001)—high-income countries translate abstract principles into concrete requirements more successfully. Operationalization demands legal sophistication, auditing capabilities, and administrative infrastructure that wealth can facilitate.

The smallest gap is Rights Protection (E2) (d = 0.11, p = .053). Rights language is universal: developing and wealthy countries alike invoke privacy, non-discrimination, and due process with similar sophistication, reflecting decades of international human rights law. Countries can draw on UDHR Article 12 or ICCPR Article 26 without requiring wealth.

The remaining dimensions—E1 (d = 0.13), E3 (d = 0.19), E5 (d = 0.18)—show small effects. Gaps of 0.08-0.17 points on 4-point scales are substantively negligible.

Income matters for technical operationalization but not for normative commitments. Development interventions should focus on operationalization support (audit tools, impact assessment templates) rather than ethical principles, where developing countries already demonstrate sophistication.

### Regional Patterns {#sec-eth-regional}

If GDP doesn't explain ethics variation, do regional patterns? Shared legal systems, colonial histories, or policy networks might create ethics governance clusters.

![Regional heatmap for ethics scores. Regional variation is less pronounced than for capacity.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_region_heatmap.png){#fig-eth-region-heatmap}

@fig-eth-region-heatmap shows regional variation is less pronounced for ethics than for capacity. Most regions cluster near the global mean of 0.61. North America (0.67) and Europe (0.64) have modest advantages, but smaller than for capacity. Latin America (0.59) approaches the global mean; Sub-Saharan Africa (0.53) lags but not as dramatically as for capacity.

Regions cannot "buy" sophisticated ethics through development alone. Some wealthy regions (East Asia) show modest ethics scores despite high GDP; some developing regions (LAC) approach high-income levels. Countries develop ethical frameworks based on domestic political traditions and civil society pressure rather than importing regional models.

### Policy-Type Variation {#sec-eth-policy-type}

Do different policy instruments show distinct ethics profiles? Strategies might emphasize ethics while binding regulations focus on compliance.

![Ethics scores by policy type.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_policy_type.png){#fig-eth-policy-type}

@fig-eth-policy-type shows strategies and frameworks score highest (mean ≈ 0.75), followed by binding regulations (0.62), with guidance documents trailing (0.55). This differs from capacity, where binding regulation scored highest.

Strategies explicitly aim to articulate normative commitments as their primary purpose. Binding regulations focus on compliance requirements, producing higher capacity but lower ethics scores—they often assume ethical premises implicitly without developing them. Guidance documents address narrow technical issues where ethics may seem tangential.

Comprehensive AI governance requires layered architectures: aspirational strategies for ethical foundations, binding regulations to operationalize principles, and technical guidance for implementation.

### Temporal Trends {#sec-eth-temporal}

Are ethics scores improving, declining, or stable over time?

![Temporal trend in ethics scores (2017–2025).](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_temporal_trend.png){#fig-eth-temporal}

@fig-eth-temporal shows a notable pattern: overall ethics scores decline modestly from 2017 to 2025, with particularly sharp drops in high-income countries (detailed in @sec-eth-dynamics). The early wave (2017-2019) emphasized ethical principles and stakeholder inclusion. Foundational strategies from Canada, France, and Germany functioned as normative deliberations, naturally scoring high on ethics.

By 2020-2025, more technical and sectoral policies proliferated: procurement standards, auditing requirements, sector-specific guidelines. These assume ethical foundations from earlier frameworks and focus on operational details, producing higher capacity but lower ethics scores. The EU AI Act (2024) exemplifies this: high capacity scores (clear authorities, enforcement) but lower ethics scores (assuming rather than articulating foundations).

This decline likely reflects governance maturation rather than ethical regression. Having established frameworks, countries now develop implementation infrastructure within them.

### Correlation Structure {#sec-eth-correlations}

Do the five ethics dimensions identify separable governance components, or do they collapse into a single "ethics engagement" factor?

![Correlation matrix for the five ethics dimensions.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_correlations.png){#fig-eth-correlations}

@fig-eth-correlations shows moderate-to-strong positive correlations, all exceeding r = 0.40. The strongest: E1 Framework Depth and E4 Operationalisation (r ≈ 0.72)—policies with sophisticated frameworks also tend to operationalize them. Frameworks without operationalization produce aspirational documents; operationalization without frameworks produces normatively hollow governance.

Similarly, E3 Governance Mechanisms and E5 Inclusion correlate at r ≈ 0.68. Accountability structures and stakeholder inclusion go together: mechanisms without input risk technocratic disconnection; inclusion without mechanisms risks empty consultation.

Despite these correlations, the dimensions remain separable. The PCA analysis in @sec-pca-nexus confirms that capacity and ethics (r = 0.75) constitute empirically distinct constructs — policies can have sophisticated capacity with minimal ethics, or vice versa.
