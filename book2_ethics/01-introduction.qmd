## Measuring Normative Commitments in AI Governance {#sec-intro}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Section summary.** How deeply do AI policies embed ethical commitments? This section introduces the research question, examines gaps in ethics governance measurement, and previews our analytical framework.

### Beyond Principle Proliferation

The AI ethics landscape shows remarkable normative convergence. @jobin2019 found recurring principles (transparency, fairness, accountability) across 84 guidelines. @fjeld2020 found similar patterns in 36 frameworks.

But convergence on *principles* doesn't guarantee *governance depth*. Do policies merely list values, or do they specify rights protections, establish participatory mechanisms, operationalize principles, and ensure inclusive engagement?

This study measures ethics governance depth across five dimensions:

1. *E1 Framework Depth*: Specificity of ethical principles and value articulation
2. *E2 Rights Protection*: Safeguards for privacy, fairness, non-discrimination, due process
3. *E3 Participatory Governance*: Public consultation, multi-stakeholder processes, transparency
4. *E4 Operationalization*: Concrete requirements, compliance mechanisms, enforcement
5. *E5 Inclusion*: Representation of marginalized groups, accessibility, equity considerations

Analysis of 2,100+ policies reveals low depth overall (mean 1.39/4.0, with superficial ethical commitments in most policies), narrowing ethics gaps between income groups, extreme within-group inequality (99% of variation within income groups), a documentation confound where the income gap (d = 0.20) reverses (d = −0.09) for well-documented policies, and horizontal diffusion through peer learning rather than top-down transfer.

The book proceeds as follows: @sec-literature reviews theoretical foundations; @sec-methods-summary outlines data and scoring (with full details in the companion *Data, Methods, and Technical Appendices* volume); @sec-eth-landscape maps the global ethics landscape; @sec-eth-determinants examines determinants; @sec-eth-inequality analyses inequality patterns; @sec-eth-dynamics traces temporal dynamics and convergence; @sec-robustness presents robustness checks; and @sec-discussion and @sec-conclusion discuss implications. The following sections demonstrate that developing countries increasingly match or exceed wealthy-country ethics commitments.
