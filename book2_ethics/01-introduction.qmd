## Measuring Normative Commitments in AI Governance {#sec-intro}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** How deeply do AI policies embed ethical commitments? This chapter introduces the research question, examines gaps in ethics governance measurement, and previews our analytical framework.

### Beyond Principle Proliferation

The AI ethics landscape shows remarkable normative convergence. @jobin2019 found recurring principles (transparency, fairness, accountability) across 84 guidelines. @fjeld2020 found similar patterns in 36 frameworks.

But convergence on *principles* doesn't guarantee *governance depth*. Do policies merely list values, or do they specify rights protections, establish participatory mechanisms, operationalize principles, and ensure inclusive engagement?

This book measures ethics governance depth across five dimensions:

1. *E1 Framework Depth*: Specificity of ethical principles and value articulation
2. *E2 Rights Protection*: Safeguards for privacy, fairness, non-discrimination, due process
3. *E3 Participatory Governance*: Public consultation, multi-stakeholder processes, transparency
4. *E4 Operationalization*: Concrete requirements, compliance mechanisms, enforcement
5. *E5 Inclusion*: Representation of marginalized groups, accessibility, equity considerations

### Key Findings Preview

Analysis of 2,100+ policies reveals:

- Low depth overall: Mean 1.39/4.0, with superficial ethical commitments in most policies
- Convergence: Ethics gaps narrowing faster than capacity gaps
- Within-group inequality: 99% of variation occurs within income groups
- Documentation confound: The income gap (d=0.20) reverses (d=-0.09) for well-documented policies
- Horizontal diffusion: Regional ethics norms spread through peer learning

### Roadmap

- **Chapter 9**: Global ethics governance landscape
- **Chapter 10**: Determinants of ethics depth
- **Chapter 11**: Inequality patterns
- **Chapter 12**: Temporal dynamics and convergence
- **Chapter 14**: Robustness checks
- **Chapters 15-16**: Implications and conclusions

The following chapters show that developing countries increasingly match wealthy-country ethics commitments.
