## GDP and Ethics Governance {#sec-eth-determinants}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Section summary.** This section examines a key asymmetry between capacity and ethics: while GDP has a modest positive effect on capacity, it shows no effect on ethics scores at any quantile. The OLS significance is entirely driven by the extensive margin (whether any policy exists).
:::

The landscape analysis documented low ethics scores overall, with over a third of policies scoring zero. This section asks what drives variation in ethics governance depth. A common assumption treats ethical governance as a luxury—something only wealthy nations can afford after meeting basic institutional needs. The regression analysis that follows tests this assumption through OLS, quantile, and Tobit specifications. The results reveal a striking asymmetry with the capacity domain: whereas GDP exerts a modest effect on implementation capacity, it shows virtually no effect on ethics governance at any point in the distribution.

### OLS Regression {#sec-eth-ols}

![Scatter plot of ethics scores against log GDP per capita.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_gdp_scatter.png){#fig-eth-gdp-scatter}

@fig-eth-gdp-scatter shows a weak positive association with substantial scatter. The OLS regression:

| Variable | $\beta$ | SE | $t$ | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| log(GDP pc) | 0.061 | 0.020 | 3.05 | .002 |
| Good text quality | 1.014 | — | — | < .001 |

: OLS regression for ethics (selected coefficients) {#tbl-eth-ols}

@tbl-eth-ols shows β = 0.061 (p = .002), apparently supporting the "luxury good" hypothesis. However, as quantile regression reveals below, this significance represents a statistical artifact.

Text quality dominates (β = 1.014, p < .001): well-documented policies score a full point higher than poorly documented ones. This effect exceeds that of GDP.

The methodological issue: OLS assumes GDP's effect remains constant across the distribution. However, with 36.3% of policies scoring exactly zero, GDP may operate through the *extensive margin* (whether any ethics content exists) rather than the *intensive margin* (sophistication level among policies with ethics content).

### Quantile Regression: The Zero-Effect Finding {#sec-eth-quantile}

Quantile regression estimates GDP's effect at different distribution points. If GDP facilitates ethics throughout, coefficients should be positive at all percentiles. If GDP affects only the extensive margin, coefficients should approach zero at all positive-score quantiles.

![Quantile regression coefficients for GDP across the ethics distribution. GDP shows no effect at any quantile—a flat line at β = 0.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_quantile_regression.png){#fig-eth-qr}

@fig-eth-qr delivers the central finding: the regression line is flat at β ≈ 0 across the entire distribution.

| Quantile ($\tau$) | GDP $\beta$ | SE | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 | 0.000 | — | n.s. |
| OLS (reference) | 0.061 | 0.020 | .002 |

: Quantile regression: GDP effect across the ethics distribution {#tbl-eth-qr}

GDP shows no effect at any quantile examined. The OLS significance arises entirely from the extensive margin—wealthier countries produce more policies overall, mechanically increasing the probability that at least one contains ethics content. Conditional on having a non-zero ethics score, GDP contributes nothing.

This contradicts the "luxury good" hypothesis. Countries at any income level produce policies with sophisticated ethics frameworks. Kenya's AI and Data Protection regulations, Brazil's AI Ethics Framework, and Colombia's AI strategy all demonstrate high ethics scores despite modest GDP levels. Conversely, wealthy countries often produce ethics-light policies focusing on technical compliance.

The asymmetry with capacity is interpretable: capacity requires fiscal resources and infrastructure; ethical commitment requires political will and stakeholder engagement—factors unrelated to GDP.

For development interventions, these findings suggest that promoting ethical AI governance need not wait for economic growth. Supporting political processes that enable ethical deliberation, strengthening civil society organizations advocating for rights, and providing operationalization assistance can proceed regardless of income level.

### Multilevel and Tobit Models {#sec-eth-multilevel}

Quantile regression treated policies as independent. Multilevel modeling accounts for nesting within countries, correcting for dependency that inflates standard errors. The key parameter is the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)—the proportion of variation occurring between vs. within countries.

![Country random effects from the multilevel ethics model.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/robustness/fig_country_random_effects.png){#fig-eth-re}

@fig-eth-re shows country random effects. Iceland, Rwanda, and Nigeria consistently produce higher-ethics policies than GDP predicts; Kazakhstan and several wealthy Asian countries underperform.

| Metric | OLS | Mixed |
|:---|---:|---:|
| GDP $\beta$ | 0.061 | 0.029 |
| GDP $p$ | .002 | .38 |
| Country ICC | — | **0.125** |

: Multilevel model comparison for ethics {#tbl-eth-multilevel}

Two findings from @tbl-eth-multilevel: (1) The GDP coefficient collapses from β = 0.061 (p = .002) to β = 0.029 (p = .38)—a 52% reduction and complete loss of significance. The multilevel model properly attributes within-country correlation to random effects rather than spuriously to GDP. (2) Country ICC = 0.125: 12.5% of variation is between countries; 87.5% is within countries. Policy-specific factors—document purpose, authoring agency, consultation processes—matter far more than national characteristics.

The random effects identify consistent over-performers (Iceland, Rwanda, Nigeria) — countries where political commitment to ethics exceeds GDP predictions.

**Tobit Regression.** With 36.3% zero-score rates (exceeding capacity's 27.6%), OLS and quantile regression may be biased. Zero-scoring policies represent complete absence of ethics, not "minimal ethics." Tobit regression models this censoring.

![Comparison of OLS and Tobit coefficients for the ethics model.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_tobit_comparison.png){#fig-eth-tobit}

| Variable | OLS $\beta$ | Tobit $\beta$ |
|:---|---:|---:|
| log(GDP pc) | 0.061 | 0.100 |
| Good text quality | — | 1.014 |
| $\sigma$ | — | 0.700 |
| P(uncensored at mean) | — | 0.725 |
| Floor: score = 0 | 36.3% | — |

: Tobit model for ethics {#tbl-eth-tobit}

Censoring correction increases the GDP coefficient from β = 0.061 (OLS) to β = 0.100 (Tobit). But interpreted alongside the quantile finding: this effect operates entirely through the extensive margin (reducing probability of zeros) rather than improving positive scores. Wealthy countries are more likely to produce *some* ethics content, but conditional on having content, GDP contributes nothing to quality.

**Synthesis.** GDP does not predict ethics governance quality. OLS shows nominal significance (β = 0.061, p = .002), but this proves artifactual: quantile regression reveals no effect at any quantile, and multilevel modeling eliminates significance entirely (β = 0.029, p = .38). The Tobit model confirms that GDP operates only through the extensive margin—wealthier countries are more likely to produce *some* ethics content, but conditional on having content, GDP contributes nothing to quality.

The asymmetry with capacity is interpretable: implementation requires resources that wealth provides, whereas ethical governance requires political will, democratic traditions, and civil society strength—factors independent of GDP. Kenya, Colombia, Brazil, and Rwanda demonstrate sophisticated ethics frameworks despite modest GDP. Kazakhstan's resource wealth fails to generate ethics governance. Promoting ethical AI governance need not wait for economic growth.
