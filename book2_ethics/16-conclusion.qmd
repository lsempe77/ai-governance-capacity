## Toward Operationalised Ethics Governance {#sec-conclusion}

*How deeply do AI policies embed ethical commitments?* The evidence indicates: not very deeply. The modal policy scores below 2/4 on operationalisation, invoking principles without governance depth. Over 36% of all policies contain zero ethics content, and 97% fall below the scale midpoint.

Yet the distributional patterns offer grounds for cautious optimism.

### Main Findings

**Ethics governance is not contingent on economic development.** GDP shows no effect on ethics scores at any quantile. Countries at any income level can embed rights protections, establish participatory mechanisms, and operationalise ethical principles. Kenya, Brazil, Colombia, Rwanda, Iceland, and Nigeria all demonstrate this, achieving ethics scores that exceed GDP predictions. This contradicts the "luxury good" narrative that treats ethical governance as a post-development achievement.

**Gaps are narrowing, through an unexpected mechanism.** Developing countries have not caught up to high-income standards; rather, high-income countries have declined as governance shifts from aspirational frameworks to technical regulation. If trends continue, the gap closes entirely by 2030. Whether this convergence is encouraging (maturation) or concerning (erosion of normative foundations) depends on whether later technical policies successfully operationalise the principles that earlier frameworks articulated.

**Within-group inequality dominates.** Approximately 99.5% of ethics variation occurs within income groups—even more extreme than capacity's 98.8%. The conventional framing of a global North-South ethics divide obscures the reality that political will, democratic traditions, and civil society strength—not national wealth—drive ethics governance depth.

**Operationalisation remains the binding constraint.** Convergence on principle *mention* means little without compliance mechanisms and enforcement capacity. E4 Operationalisation scores lowest among dimensions, and the gap between articulating principles and implementing them characterises global AI governance regardless of income level.

**Documentation quality confounds cross-national comparison.** The income-group gap (d = 0.20) reverses sign (d = −0.09) for well-documented policies. Developing countries' true ethics commitments likely exceed what available texts suggest. This finding carries methodological implications for any text-based governance comparison.

### Future Research and the Observatory Vision

Several directions warrant investigation. **First**, validating LLM ethics scores against human expert coding would test whether automated scoring captures the nuances of ethical governance that rubric-based assessment intends to measure. **Second**, tracking the same jurisdictions over time would enable within-country panel analysis, testing whether specific policy interventions produce measurable improvements. **Third**, linking policy text scores to implementation outcomes would address the fundamental question this study cannot: do policies that score high on ethics governance actually produce better outcomes for affected populations? **Fourth**, extending analysis to sector-specific policies would test whether ethics governance varies across application domains. **Fifth**, the convergence-through-decline finding motivates research on normative sustainability: do countries that shift from aspirational to technical governance successfully embed ethical principles in implementation?

The findings presented here are descriptive and correlational. The non-effect of GDP on ethics could reflect reverse causation, omitted variables (democratic maturity driving both), or genuine causal independence. Establishing causal relationships would require quasi-experimental designs exploiting exogenous shocks to governance or instrumental variable approaches.

**The Observatory Vision.** The research infrastructure developed here—the scraping pipeline, text extraction tools, LLM scoring framework, and analytical code—supports a living observatory of AI ethics governance. Practical applications include annual scoring rounds tracking how ethics governance evolves as countries revise policies and adopt new instruments; country-level ethics scorecards providing dimension-specific benchmarks against regional and income-group peers; operationalisation toolkits translating abstract principle scores into concrete improvement recommendations; and open-source benchmarking tools enabling governments, civil society organisations, and international bodies to assess their own policies against the global distribution.

The observatory model is particularly valuable for tracking whether the convergence trend continues—and whether it ultimately reflects governance maturation or normative erosion.

*Ethics governance ultimately reflects political commitment to translate values into enforceable requirements—building infrastructure that makes principles meaningful.*
