## Toward Operationalized Ethics Governance {#sec-conclusion}

*How deeply do AI policies embed ethical commitments?* The evidence suggests: not very deeply. The modal policy scores below 2/4 on operationalization, invoking principles without governance depth.

Yet the distribution offers grounds for optimism. Ethics gaps are converging as developing countries match wealthy-country commitments. GDP shows no relationship with ethics quality at any quantile examined. Nearly all variation (99%) occurs within income groups, with Tunisia, Brazil, and Canada achieving high scores regardless of wealth. And when documentation quality is comparable, the income gap disappears entirely—even reversing sign.

These findings carry several implications for policy and research.

First, normative governance is not contingent on economic development. Countries at any income level can embed rights protections, establish participatory mechanisms, and operationalize ethical principles.

Second, gaps are narrowing. Developing countries have increasingly avoided the principle-heavy, implementation-light approach that characterized early high-income frameworks.

Third, operationalization remains the binding constraint. Convergence on principles means little without compliance mechanisms and enforcement capacity.

Fourth, documentation quality confounds cross-national comparison. Developing countries' true commitments likely exceed what available texts suggest.

Finally, political will—not economic resources—drives variation. Countries at similar GDP levels show vastly different ethics depth, suggesting governance quality reflects domestic political choices.

### The Observatory Vision

This research points toward a living observatory for ethics governance—one that continuously tracks operationalization depth, enables country-level scorecards, and supports benchmarking.

*Ethics governance ultimately reflects political commitment to translate values into enforceable requirements—building infrastructure that makes principles meaningful.*
