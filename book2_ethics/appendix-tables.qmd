## Detailed Regression Output {#sec-appendix-tables}

This appendix provides comprehensive regression diagnostics and extended model specifications for all statistical analyses presented in the report. The purpose is to support reproducibility, enable methodological scrutiny, and provide additional detail for readers interested in the technical foundations of the findings reported in @sec-eth-determinants and subsequent analytical chapters. All models were estimated in R using standard packages (`lme4` for multilevel models, `quantreg` for quantile regression, `VGAM` for Tobit models) with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (HC1) where applicable. Full replication code is available in the project GitHub repository.

### Implementation Capacity Models: Extended Diagnostics

The capacity analysis employs four complementary regression specifications to ensure robustness of the income-group gap estimates. Each specification addresses a different potential concern about model assumptions or functional form.

**Ordinary Least Squares with Full Controls.** The baseline OLS model regresses the composite capacity score on income group, log GDP per capita, policy type, binding nature, text quality, and year fixed effects. This model achieves an $R^2$ of 0.436 (adjusted $R^2 = 0.434$), indicating that the covariates explain approximately 44% of the variance in capacity scores—a respectable fit for cross-sectional policy data. The sample size is $N = 1{,}949$ after excluding policies with missing covariates. The $F$-statistic is highly significant ($p < .001$), confirming that the model as a whole has explanatory power. The residual standard error is 0.581 on the 0–4 scale, indicating that the typical prediction error is approximately 0.6 points—substantial but acceptable given the ordinal nature of the outcome and the inherent noisiness of text-based governance measures.

Diagnostic plots (available in the replication materials) reveal no major violations of OLS assumptions. Residuals are approximately normally distributed with slight negative skewness, heteroskedasticity is modest and corrected via HC1 standard errors, and there are no influential outliers with Cook's distance exceeding conventional thresholds.

**Multilevel Random-Intercept Model.** The multilevel model accounts for the nested structure of the data: policies (level 1) are clustered within countries (level 2). The model estimates a random intercept for each country, allowing baseline governance capacity to vary across jurisdictions while assuming that covariate effects (slopes) are constant. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is 0.091, indicating that approximately 9% of the total variance in capacity scores occurs *between* countries, while 91% occurs *within* countries—confirming the dominance of within-country heterogeneity.

The between-country variance component is $\sigma^2_u = 0.051$, while the within-country (residual) variance is $\sigma^2_\varepsilon = 0.510$. The likelihood ratio test comparing this model to the OLS specification is significant ($\chi^2(1) = 7.30$, $p = .007$), confirming that the multilevel structure improves model fit. However, the substantive conclusions remain unchanged: the income-group coefficient is similar in magnitude and significance to the OLS estimate, indicating that accounting for country-level clustering does not materially alter the finding of a small but significant income gap.

**Quantile Regression: Heterogeneous Effects Across the Distribution.** The quantile regression models estimate covariate effects at the 10th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th, and 90th percentiles of the capacity score distribution. This approach relaxes the OLS assumption that covariate effects are constant across the distribution, allowing us to test whether the income-group gap is larger for high-performing policies (upper quantiles) or low-performing policies (lower quantiles). The key finding is that the income effect is remarkably stable across quantiles, ranging from $\beta = 0.15$ at the 10th percentile to $\beta = 0.22$ at the 90th percentile, with overlapping 95% confidence intervals. This stability suggests that the small income gap observed in the OLS model is not an artefact of averaging across heterogeneous subpopulations.

Full coefficient tables for all five quantiles, including bootstrapped standard errors (1,000 iterations), are available in the JSON file at `data/analysis/paper1_capacity/extended/quantile_results.json`. The bootstrap procedure accounts for the dependence structure induced by country clustering.

**Tobit Model: Addressing Left-Censoring at Zero.** The Tobit model addresses the left-censoring issue arising from the fact that 27.6% of policies score exactly 0 on at least one dimension, creating a pile-up at the lower boundary of the 0–4 scale. Standard OLS treats these zeros as observed values, but if some policies "would" score below zero if the scale permitted (i.e., they lack even the minimal features captured by a score of 1), OLS estimates may be biased. The Tobit model, which assumes an underlying latent continuous variable that is censored at zero, provides an alternative estimator.

The Tobit model yields a scale parameter $\sigma = 0.742$, larger than the OLS residual standard error, reflecting the additional variance attributed to the latent censored observations. The log-likelihood and detailed coefficient estimates are reported in `tobit_results.json`. The Tobit income-group coefficient is slightly larger than the OLS estimate but substantively similar, confirming that left-censoring does not meaningfully distort the income-gap findings. The model was estimated using the `VGAM` package in R with the L-BFGS-B optimiser as the primary method, supplemented by Nelder-Mead for robustness checks.

### Ethics Operationalisation Models: Parallel Specifications

The ethics analysis employs an identical set of regression specifications (OLS, multilevel, quantile, Tobit) to those used for capacity, ensuring methodological consistency and enabling direct comparison of determinants across the two governance dimensions. The ethics models are documented in parallel JSON files located in the ethics analysis directory. Key results are summarised in @sec-eth-determinants.

The ethics OLS model achieves an $R^2$ of 0.412, slightly lower than the capacity model, reflecting the greater difficulty of predicting ethics scores from structural covariates. The multilevel ICC for ethics is 0.125, marginally higher than for capacity, indicating that country-level factors explain a slightly larger (though still modest) share of ethics variation. The quantile regression reveals a critical difference: the income effect on ethics is near-zero and non-significant across all quantiles, contrasting sharply with the small but consistent capacity effect. This finding is central to the discussion in @sec-discussion.

### Sensitivity Analysis Tables: Robustness Across Specifications

The sensitivity analysis, reported in @sec-robustness, compares the income-group coefficient across six alternative model specifications designed to test the fragility of the main findings. These specifications include: (1) excluding international organisations, (2) treating the outcome as ordinal (cumulative logit model), (3) winsorising extreme values at the 1st and 99th percentiles, (4) using alternative income classifications (World Bank lending groups instead of OECD binary), (5) restricting to high text-quality policies only, and (6) estimating separate models for pre-2020 and post-2020 subsamples.

The sensitivity table, which presents side-by-side coefficient estimates and standard errors for all six specifications, is available as a CSV file. The table reveals that the capacity income-group gap is robust across all specifications *except* the text-quality restriction (Specification 5), which eliminates the gap entirely—the single most consequential finding in the study, as discussed in @sec-text-quality and @sec-discussion. The ethics income-group coefficient, by contrast, is near-zero and non-significant across all specifications, including the full sample.

Sensitivity tables are available at:

- Capacity: [sensitivity_table.csv](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/robustness/sensitivity_table.csv)
- Ethics: [sensitivity_table.csv](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/robustness/sensitivity_table.csv)

These tables are designed for direct inclusion in meta-analyses or replication studies and include not only point estimates and standard errors but also sample sizes, $R^2$ values, and specification notes.
