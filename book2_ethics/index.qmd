# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book presents the first systematic global assessment of AI ethics governance—measuring the depth and specificity of normative commitments in AI policies worldwide.

Drawing on 2,100+ policies across 70+ jurisdictions, we score each policy on five ethics dimensions: framework depth, rights protection, participatory governance, operationalization, and inclusion. The analysis reveals a landscape where ethical commitments vary more within income groups than between them.

## Key Findings

- *Ethics convergence*: Gaps narrowing over time as developing countries strengthen ethical frameworks
- *Horizontal diffusion*: Regional policy learning dominates over North-South transfer
- *Within-group inequality*: 99% of variation occurs within income groups
- *Documentation confound*: Apparent gaps disappear for well-documented policies

## Methodology

We employ an LLM ensemble (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.0) achieving ICC = 0.827 (excellent inter-rater reliability), enabling policy analysis at unprecedented scale.
