## Country-Level Results {#sec-appendix-countries}

This appendix provides comprehensive country-level diagnostics derived from the analysis presented throughout the report. The purpose is to enable jurisdictions, international organisations, and civil society actors to benchmark individual countries against the global distribution of AI governance capacity and ethics scores. All data presented here are computed from the 2,216 policies in the OECD.AI corpus (January 2026 snapshot), aggregated to the jurisdiction level using mean scores across all policies issued by each country.

The full country dataset, including dimension-level scores, policy counts, and temporal coverage, is available at `data/analysis/shared/master_dataset.csv` and on the project GitHub repository at <https://github.com/lsempe77/ai-governance-capacity>.

**Country Rankings by Implementation Capacity.** The capacity rankings order jurisdictions by their mean composite capacity score, which aggregates performance across the five ICE capacity dimensions: Clarity, Resources, Authority, Accountability, and Coherence. Countries with higher mean scores demonstrate, on average, more operationally robust AI policies with clearer objectives, better-resourced implementation plans, stronger institutional mandates, and more comprehensive monitoring frameworks. However, as discussed in the capacity analysis, within-country variation often exceeds between-country differences—some countries have both highly operational and highly aspirational policies in their corpus.

The full ranking of all 70+ jurisdictions is available at [country_rankings.csv](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/country_rankings.csv). The top-performing jurisdictions are presented in the capacity landscape chapter. It is important to note that these rankings reflect the *policy texts* analysed, not the actual *implementation quality* on the ground. Text-based governance measures capture de jure capacity rather than de facto performance.

**Country Rankings by Ethics Operationalisation.** The ethics rankings order jurisdictions by their mean ethics composite score, aggregating performance across the five ICE ethics dimensions: Framework Depth, Rights Protection, Governance Mechanisms, Operationalisation, and Inclusion. Higher scores indicate policies that more comprehensively articulate ethical principles, specify rights-protective mechanisms (transparency, accountability, non-discrimination), establish governance structures (ethics boards, impact assessments), translate principles into concrete requirements, and ensure inclusive stakeholder participation.

The full ranking is available at [country_rankings.csv](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/country_rankings.csv). As with capacity, these rankings measure *policy content* rather than *ethical outcomes*. A country may score highly on ethics operationalisation yet fail to enforce those provisions in practice, or conversely, may achieve strong ethical outcomes through institutional norms not captured in formal policy text.

**Cluster Assignments: Two Governance Regimes.** The cluster analysis identifies two distinct governance regimes in the global AI policy landscape. Countries are assigned to clusters based on K-means analysis of their mean dimension scores across all five capacity (or ethics) dimensions. The two-cluster solution was selected based on silhouette score optimisation and reflects a fundamental bifurcation in the global governance distribution.

*Cluster 1 ("Low Governance")* comprises countries whose policies, on average, score in the lower range of the distribution—predominantly aspirational documents with limited operational infrastructure. These policies tend to articulate broad strategic goals but provide minimal detail on implementation pathways, resource allocation, or accountability mechanisms. Membership in this cluster does not imply governance failure; many countries in Cluster 1 are in early stages of AI governance development and may strengthen their frameworks over time.

*Cluster 2 ("Moderate Governance")* includes countries with above-average scores, characterised by more operationally detailed policies that specify concrete implementation mechanisms. These policies are more likely to include measurable targets, designated institutional authorities, monitoring frameworks, and stakeholder engagement processes. However, even within this cluster, the modal score remains below 2/4 on the ICE scale, indicating that "moderate" governance is far from exemplary.

Full cluster assignments are available at [country_clusters.csv](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/country_clusters.csv) for capacity and [country_clusters.csv](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/country_clusters.csv) for ethics. As documented in the capacity inequality analysis, income composition is nearly identical across the two clusters—approximately 80% high-income and 15% developing countries in both—confirming that cluster membership reflects policy design choices rather than economic constraints.

**Efficiency Frontier Rankings.** The efficiency frontier analysis ranks countries not by their absolute governance scores but by their *performance relative to GDP expectations*. This metric captures whether a country "punches above its weight" (achieving governance quality that exceeds what its GDP per capita would predict) or "underperforms" (scoring below GDP-based expectations).

The efficiency ranking is computed using Free Disposal Hull (FDH) frontier analysis, a non-parametric method that identifies the "production frontier" of maximum governance quality achieved at each GDP level. Countries on or near the frontier are maximally efficient; countries far below the frontier have unrealised governance potential given their economic resources. Countries such as Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, and Brazil exemplify high efficiency—achieving governance scores 2.3–3.1 times higher than their GDP-predicted values—while several wealthy nations underperform relative to their economic capacity.

Full efficiency rankings are available at [efficiency_ranking.csv](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/frontier/efficiency_ranking.csv) for capacity and [efficiency_ranking.csv](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/efficiency_ranking.csv) for ethics. These rankings provide actionable diagnostics for policymakers: countries with low efficiency scores have institutional headroom to strengthen governance without necessarily increasing fiscal outlays.
