## Shared Methodology {#sec-methods-summary}

This study analyses 2,216 AI policies from the OECD.AI Policy Observatory, scored by a three-model LLM ensemble (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.0) on 10 governance dimensions. The full methodological details — corpus construction, scoring rubrics, inter-rater reliability, and technical validation — are documented in the companion volume:

> **[Book 4: Data, Methods, and Technical Appendices](../book4_methods/)**

Key parameters for reference:

| Parameter | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Corpus size | 2,216 policies, 70+ jurisdictions, 2017–2025 |
| Document retrieval | 94% coverage (2,085 full texts) |
| Analysis-ready text | 1,754 documents (79.2%), 11.4 million words |
| Scoring models | Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, Gemini Flash 2.0 |
| Inter-rater reliability | ICC(2,1) = 0.827 ("Excellent") |
| Score agreement | 95.4% of scores within 1 point across models |

### Ethics Scoring Framework

Each policy was scored 0–4 on five **ethics governance** dimensions grounded in AI ethics literature [@jobin2019; @floridi2018; @oecd2019; @unesco2021; @euaiact2024]:

| Code | Dimension | What It Measures |
|:---|:---|:---|
| E1 | Ethical Framework Depth | Grounding in principles, coherent ethical vision |
| E2 | Rights Protection | Privacy, non-discrimination, human oversight, transparency |
| E3 | Governance Mechanisms | Ethics boards, impact assessments, auditing |
| E4 | Operationalisation | Concrete requirements, standards, certification |
| E5 | Inclusion & Participation | Stakeholder processes, marginalised group representation |

: Ethics scoring dimensions {#tbl-eth-dims}

Alongside the five ethics dimensions, each policy was also scored on five parallel **capacity dimensions** (C1 Clarity & Specificity, C2 Resources & Budget, C3 Authority & Enforcement, C4 Accountability & M&E, C5 Coherence & Coordination). The capacity scores inform cross-domain comparisons within this report and are analysed in depth in Book 1. Composite scores are unweighted means: *Capacity* = mean(C1–C5), *Ethics* = mean(E1–E5). The full scoring rubric, validation protocol, and robustness checks appear in Book 4.
