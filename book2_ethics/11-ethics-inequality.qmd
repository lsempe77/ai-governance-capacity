## Ethics Inequality and Governance Profiles {#sec-eth-inequality}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** Inequality decomposition for ethics mirrors the capacity findings: 99.5% of variation is within income groups. Portfolio breadth is near-universal, but E2 Rights and E5 Inclusion show the largest coverage gaps.

### Inequality Decomposition {#sec-eth-gini}

Capacity analysis showed 98.8% of governance variation within income groups. The ethics domain exhibits a similar pattern.

We use Gini coefficients, Lorenz curves, and Theil decomposition to partition ethics inequality into between-group and within-group components.

@fig-eth-lorenz shows the developing-country curve bows further from the equality line, indicating greater heterogeneity.

| Metric | Value |
|:---|---:|
| Gini (all countries) | 0.569 |
| Gini (HI only) | 0.553 |
| Gini (Developing) | 0.638 |
| Gini (country means) | 0.273 |

: Gini coefficients for ethics scores {#tbl-eth-gini}

@tbl-eth-gini shows ethics inequality exceeds capacity inequality (0.569 vs. 0.518 Gini), reflecting the severe floor effect (36.3% zeros). Ethical engagement is polarized: countries either commit substantially or ignore it almost entirely.

A key asymmetry: developing countries show higher inequality (0.638) than high-income countries (0.553). Developing countries span the full spectrum—Kenya, Colombia, Brazil, and Rwanda match or exceed many high-income countries, while others produce near-zero policies. High-income countries converge on moderate scores with fewer extremes.

The country-means Gini (0.273) is lower because averaging smooths policy-level variation. Some countries consistently outperform others, reflecting political and institutional factors rather than wealth.

#### Theil Decomposition

Theil's index enables exact additive decomposition of inequality into between-group and within-group components.

![Theil decomposition: 99.5% of ethics inequality is within income groups.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_theil_decomposition.png){#fig-eth-theil}

@fig-eth-theil shows the between-group slice is barely visible.

| Component | Share |
|:---|---:|
| Between income groups | 0.5% |
| Within income groups | 99.5% |

: Theil decomposition for ethics {#tbl-eth-theil}

Only 0.5% of ethics inequality is between income groups; 99.5% is within. This is even more extreme than capacity's 1.2%. Knowing whether a policy comes from a high-income or developing country tells you almost nothing about its ethics score.

For development policy, these findings suggest economic growth alone would do little to improve ethics governance. A country crossing the high-income threshold gains 0.12 points (3% of the scale) but still faces the same within-group variation. Targeting factors that matter—political prioritization, civil society strength, stakeholder inclusion—appears more promising than assuming growth generates ethics.

### Policy Portfolio Breadth {#sec-eth-portfolio}

Countries produce portfolios of policies. *Breadth* measures how many of the five ethics dimensions receive non-zero scores in at least one policy. A 5/5 country addresses all dimensions; 3/5 has gaps on two.

![Policy portfolio coverage for ethics dimensions.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_portfolio_heatmap.png){#fig-eth-portfolio-heatmap}

![Ethics portfolio gap analysis.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_portfolio_gaps.png){#fig-eth-portfolio-gaps}

| Metric | HI | Developing | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| Mean breadth (out of 5) | 5.00 | 4.36 | .054 |
| Countries with 5/5 coverage | 94% | — | — |
| Least covered dimensions | E2 Rights (94.1%) | E5 Inclusion (94.1%) | — |

: Ethics portfolio breadth {#tbl-eth-portfolio}

The gap is marginally significant (p = .054). High-income countries achieve near-universal coverage (94% at 5/5); developing countries average 4.36/5 with modest gaps. E2 Rights and E5 Inclusion are most commonly absent—notable because these dimensions protect marginalized populations from algorithmic harms.

Most countries engaging ethics do so comprehensively rather than cherry-picking, contrary to narratives suggesting superficial ethics adoption for international legitimacy.

### K-Means Clustering {#sec-eth-clusters}

Cluster analysis identifies distinct ethics profiles — typologies defined by dimensional strengths and weaknesses.

![Cluster profiles for ethics dimensions. Two-cluster solution mirrors the capacity pattern.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_cluster_radar.png){#fig-eth-cluster-radar}

The two-cluster solution (silhouette = 0.42) mirrors capacity:

*Cluster 1 ("Ethics-Light"):* ~65% of policies. Near-zero scores across all dimensions. These policies address AI through purely technical lenses—procurement guidelines, technical standards—without engaging ethics.

*Cluster 2 ("Ethics-Engaged"):* ~35% of policies. Moderate scores emphasizing E1 Framework Depth and E3 Governance Mechanisms. These explicitly articulate principles and establish accountability structures. National strategies and comprehensive frameworks fall here.

Both clusters contain policies from both income groups. Developing countries produce both Ethics-Light and Ethics-Engaged policies. High-income countries span both clusters. Income does not determine governance typology.

The binary characterizes global AI governance: countries either commit to comprehensive normative engagement or focus narrowly on technical implementation. Effective governance requires both types — ethics frameworks establishing foundations, plus technical policies implementing them.
