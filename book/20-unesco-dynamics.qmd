## Temporal Dynamics: Before and After UNESCO {#sec-unesco-dynamics}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** This chapter examines whether the adoption of the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI in November 2021 shifted the content of national AI policies. The overall trend is **slightly negative**: mean alignment declined from 54.6 (pre-UNESCO, $n = 727$) to 53.0 (post-UNESCO, $n = 594$), a small but statistically significant difference ($t = 2.43$, $p = .015$). However, this aggregate trend masks divergent item-level dynamics. Post-UNESCO policies show **higher** coverage of diversity (+9.4pp, $p < .001$) and fairness (+8.2pp, $p = .001$), but **lower** coverage of privacy (−12.1pp), human oversight (−10.6pp), and transparency (−9.8pp). The negative overall trend likely reflects compositional change in the policy corpus rather than genuine normative regression.

### The Pre/Post UNESCO Split {#sec-unesco-prepost}

The UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence was adopted by the UNESCO General Conference on 23 November 2021. We split the corpus at this date:

| Era | N | Period | Mean Alignment |
|:---|---:|:---|---:|
| Pre-UNESCO | 727 | ≤ 2021 | 54.6 |
| Post-UNESCO | 594 | ≥ 2022 | 53.0 |

### Yearly Trend {#sec-unesco-yearly-trend}

The time-series plot reveals **no clear upward shift** following the Recommendation's adoption. Year-to-year variation is modest, and the overall trend, if anything, is slightly downward. This is a sobering finding for proponents of international normative instruments as drivers of policy change.

### Item-Level Pre/Post Changes {#sec-unesco-prepost-items}

![Pre- and post-UNESCO coverage rates for each of the 25 UNESCO items. Bars compare the proportion of policies mentioning each item before and after November 2021.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/unesco/fig_unesco_pre_post.png){#fig-unesco-prepost}

The aggregate trend conceals substantial item-level heterogeneity. The following table shows all 25 items with their pre/post coverage rates and chi-squared test results:

| UNESCO Item | Pre (%) | Post (%) | Δ (pp) | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| Right to privacy & data protection | 56.5 | 44.4 | **−12.1** | < .001 |
| Human oversight & determination | 40.4 | 29.8 | **−10.6** | < .001 |
| Transparency & explainability | 75.9 | 66.2 | **−9.8** | < .001 |
| Health & social well-being | 41.5 | 31.8 | **−9.7** | < .001 |
| Data policy | 61.9 | 50.3 | **−11.6** | < .001 |
| Safety & security | 51.4 | 43.3 | **−8.2** | .004 |
| Diversity & inclusiveness | 66.0 | 75.4 | **+9.4** | < .001 |
| Fairness & non-discrimination | 68.8 | 76.9 | **+8.2** | .001 |
| Peaceful, just & interconnected societies | 81.4 | 85.7 | **+4.3** | .046 |
| Economy & labour | 78.0 | 81.5 | +3.5 | .135 |
| Education & research | 65.5 | 68.5 | +3.0 | .267 |
| Awareness & literacy | 65.5 | 68.5 | +3.0 | .267 |
| Communication & information | 1.7 | 2.5 | +0.9 | .356 |

: Selected pre/post UNESCO coverage changes (statistically significant items in bold) {#tbl-unesco-prepost-items}

Three striking patterns emerge:

1. **"Values winners"**: Diversity (+9.4pp) and fairness (+8.2pp) have gained significant ground in the post-UNESCO era. These are precisely the kinds of broad normative commitments that international frameworks tend to diffuse most effectively.

2. **"Technical losers"**: Privacy (−12.1pp), data policy (−11.6pp), human oversight (−10.6pp), and transparency (−9.8pp) have all **declined** significantly. This likely reflects a compositional shift: the post-2021 corpus includes more policies from jurisdictions entering the AI governance space for the first time, which may prioritise broad strategic goals over specific technical governance mechanisms.

3. **Stable items**: Most UNESCO items show changes of less than 5 percentage points — environmental items, proportionality, gender, culture, and communication remain largely unchanged.

### The Income × Temporal Interaction {#sec-unesco-prepost-income}

![Pre/post UNESCO coverage rates broken down by income group. The interaction reveals whether developing countries responded differently to the Recommendation's adoption.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/unesco/fig_unesco_pre_post_income.png){#fig-unesco-prepost-income}

The interaction between income group and the post-UNESCO era is **not significant** in the regression analysis ($\beta = -1.77$, $p = .393$). Both high-income and developing countries show similar temporal trajectories. The slight decline in overall alignment is not differentially driven by either income group.

This is an important null finding. It suggests that the UNESCO Recommendation has not (yet) produced a **differential norm diffusion** effect — developing countries have not disproportionately increased their alignment in response to the Recommendation, nor have they fallen further behind. The temporal dynamics are driven by corpus composition, not by income-differentiated policy change.

### Interpreting the Negative Trend {#sec-unesco-interp-trend}

The slight but significant decline in mean alignment from 54.6 to 53.0 ($p = .015$) warrants careful interpretation. We propose three non-exclusive explanations:

1. **Compositional change**: The post-2021 corpus includes many "new entrant" jurisdictions issuing their first AI policies. These tend to be narrower, more preliminary documents — consultation papers, sectoral guidelines, or early-stage strategies — that naturally address fewer UNESCO items than the comprehensive national strategies that dominate the pre-2021 corpus.

2. **Regulatory specialisation**: The post-2021 era has seen a shift toward **sector-specific** and **risk-based** AI regulation (exemplified by the EU AI Act). These instruments are designed to address specific governance challenges rather than to comprehensively map onto a broad normative framework like the UNESCO Recommendation. A policy that deeply regulates a narrow domain may score lower on UNESCO alignment than a broad strategy that touches many items superficially.

3. **Maturation of the governance landscape**: As AI governance matures, the marginal policy added to the corpus is increasingly a technical standard, procurement guideline, or sectoral regulation rather than a high-level strategy document. These narrower instruments serve important governance functions but are not designed to achieve comprehensive UNESCO coverage.

None of these explanations implies genuine normative regression. The decline in alignment scores reflects a healthy diversification of the AI governance toolkit, not a retreat from the UNESCO framework's normative commitments.

### The Regression Perspective {#sec-unesco-trend-regression}

The regression analysis in @sec-unesco-regression provides additional evidence. In Model 1, the post-UNESCO dummy is significant ($\beta = -1.89$, $p = .017$), but the coefficient is small — less than 2 points on a 100-point scale. In Model 2, controlling for capacity and ethics scores, it remains significant but attenuated ($\beta = -1.40$, $p = .043$). The year variable itself is not significant in any model ($p > .30$), confirming that the temporal pattern is a **level shift** (pre/post) rather than a continuous trend.

### Summary {#sec-unesco-dynamics-summary}

The temporal analysis yields a nuanced message. The UNESCO Recommendation has not produced a dramatic upward shift in policy alignment — but neither has it been irrelevant. The post-2021 period shows clear gains in diversity and fairness coverage, suggesting that the Recommendation's emphasis on inclusion and non-discrimination is diffusing into policy practice. The declines in technical governance items (privacy, oversight, transparency) are better explained by corpus composition than by normative retreat.

The policy implication is that international normative instruments like the UNESCO Recommendation may be most effective at diffusing **broad values** (diversity, fairness, peaceful societies) while having less influence on the **technical governance mechanisms** that require specialised institutional capacity. This points to a complementary role for capacity-building initiatives — such as UNESCO's own Readiness Assessment Methodology — that can help translate normative commitments into concrete governance infrastructure.
