## Convergence, Diffusion, and the Ethics Frontier {#sec-eth-dynamics}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** Unlike capacity, ethics scores are **converging** across income groups — but the mechanism is surprising: high-income countries are *declining*, not developing countries improving. The efficiency frontier for ethics again features African countries punching above their weight.

### The Convergence Finding {#sec-eth-convergence}

The capacity dynamics analysis in @sec-cap-dynamics revealed stable gaps between income groups from 2017 to 2025, with neither convergence nor divergence characterizing temporal trends. If this stability extends to ethics, it would suggest that ethical governance gaps persist despite policy diffusion and international norm-setting. Alternatively, if ethics scores show convergence, this would indicate that developing countries are successfully adopting ethical frameworks and narrowing governance gaps — or that high-income countries are declining for reasons requiring explanation.

Convergence analysis tests these scenarios by examining whether the income-group × year interaction term proves statistically significant and in which direction. A negative interaction indicates convergence (gap narrowing), a positive interaction indicates divergence (gap widening), and a near-zero interaction suggests stability. The mechanism matters as much as the direction: convergence could occur through developing countries improving (positive slope), high-income countries declining (negative slope), or both.

@fig-eth-convergence visualizes the convergence pattern, showing high-income countries' ethics scores declining steadily from 2017 to 2025 while developing countries remain relatively flat. @fig-eth-dim-convergence disaggregates this pattern across dimensions, revealing that the decline affects multiple dimensions rather than concentrating in one area.

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Income × Year interaction | $\beta = -0.031$, $p = .015$* |
| HI temporal slope | **−0.023/yr** ($p = .001$) |
| Developing temporal slope | +0.016/yr (n.s.) |
| Gap trend | **Narrowing** (−0.038/yr, $p = .018$) |

: Convergence test for ethics scores {#tbl-eth-convergence}

@tbl-eth-convergence delivers this chapter's most striking empirical finding: **ethics scores are converging** across income groups at −0.031 points per year (p = .015). Unlike capacity, where gaps remained stable, ethics gaps narrow significantly over the 2017-2025 period. But the convergence mechanism proves surprising and requires careful interpretation.

The temporal slopes reveal the source: **high-income countries decline at −0.023 points per year** (p = .001), a statistically significant downward trend indicating that wealthy countries' ethics scores systematically worsen over time. Meanwhile, **developing countries show a positive but non-significant trend** (+0.016 points per year, p > .05), suggesting modest improvement insufficient to reach statistical significance. The **gap narrows at −0.038 points per year** (p = .018) through the combination of high-income decline and modest developing-country improvement.

Why would high-income countries' ethics scores decline? Several non-exclusive explanations warrant consideration:

**Regulation Replacing Aspiration**: The early AI governance wave (2017-2020) emphasized aspirational ethics frameworks articulating principles, values, and normative commitments. Canada's 2017 Declaration on AI, France's 2018 Villani Report, and Germany's 2018 AI Strategy all functioned as extended ethical deliberations about AI's societal implications, naturally producing high ethics scores. By 2020-2025, many high-income countries shifted from aspiration to binding regulation — the EU AI Act (2024) exemplifies this transition. Binding regulations focus on compliance requirements, operational specifications, and enforcement mechanisms (scoring high on capacity) while assuming ethical foundations as background premises rather than articulating them comprehensively (scoring lower on ethics). The apparent "ethics decline" may actually reflect governance maturation: having established ethical frameworks in earlier documents, countries now develop implementation infrastructure within those frameworks.

**Ethics Fatigue**: The initial enthusiasm for AI ethics (2018-2020) generated substantial policy attention, multi-stakeholder deliberations, and comprehensive framework documents. By 2021-2025, this attention may have waned as AI governance became routine bureaucratic activity. Newer policies address technical or sectoral issues (procurement standards, sector-specific guidelines) where ethical principles seem tangential or assumed, producing lower ethics scores despite potentially operating within established ethical boundaries.

**Composition Effects**: Later high-income policies may address narrower technical or sectoral topics rather than comprehensive governance frameworks. A 2025 policy on AI procurement in healthcare naturally focuses on operational requirements rather than broad ethical principles, scoring lower on ethics dimensions without necessarily representing ethical regression. The declining trend may reflect changing policy mix rather than abandonment of ethical commitments.

**Backlash Against Ethics Frameworks**: Some high-income countries may deliberately de-emphasize ethics in response to industry pressure arguing that extensive ethical requirements stifle innovation and competitive advantage. This hypothesis finds some support in policy debates positioning AI regulation as threatening economic competitiveness, particularly vis-à-vis China's rapid AI development under less constrained ethical frameworks.

The developing-country trajectory — modest positive but non-significant improvement (+0.016/year) — suggests that international norm diffusion, technical assistance, and demonstration effects enable gradual ethics governance strengthening. But the improvement proves insufficient to reach significance, indicating substantial heterogeneity across developing countries (consistent with the 99.5% within-group variation finding).

The net convergence (−0.038 points per year) indicates that by 2030, if trends continue, the income-group ethics gap will have closed entirely. This convergence contrasts sharply with capacity's stable gaps and suggests different diffusion mechanisms: ethical principles diffuse more readily than implementation infrastructure, possibly because ethics frameworks require normative commitments and political will rather than fiscal resources and technical capacity.

### Temporal Trends {#sec-eth-temporal-trends}

The convergence finding emerged from formal statistical tests modeling income-group × year interactions, but visualizing raw temporal trends provides intuitive understanding of how ethics governance evolved over the 2017-2025 period. If ethics scores are declining uniformly across dimensions, this would suggest a general shift away from ethical considerations. If specific dimensions drive the trend while others remain stable, this would indicate selective de-emphasis of particular ethical aspects.

![Ethics dimension scores over time.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_temporal_dimensions.png){#fig-eth-temporal-dims}

![Ethics trends by income group.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_temporal_income.png){#fig-eth-temporal-income}

@fig-eth-temporal-dims shows temporal trajectories for each ethics dimension from 2017 to 2025, revealing whether all dimensions decline in parallel or whether specific dimensions drive the overall trend. The figure indicates that **E1 Framework Depth** and **E3 Governance Mechanisms** show the sharpest declines, while **E2 Rights Protection** and **E5 Inclusion** remain relatively stable. This pattern supports the "regulation replacing aspiration" hypothesis: newer binding regulations assume rights protections and stakeholder inclusion as established principles (maintaining E2 and E5 scores) while focusing implementation details rather than articulating comprehensive ethical frameworks (declining E1 and E3).

@fig-eth-temporal-income disaggregates temporal trends by income group, visualizing what @tbl-eth-convergence quantified: high-income countries show clear downward trends while developing countries remain relatively flat with possible modest improvement. The visual separation between income-group trajectories narrows over time, confirming convergence. By 2025, the gap has narrowed substantially from the 2017-2019 period when high-income ethics frameworks dominated global discourse.

### Policy Diffusion {#sec-eth-diffusion}

The capacity diffusion analysis (@sec-cap-diffusion) revealed that 98% of policy adoption occurs horizontally within income groups rather than vertically from wealthy to developing countries, challenging the Brussels Effect hypothesis. If ethics diffusion follows the same pattern, it would suggest that ethical principles spread through peer learning networks rather than top-down regulatory cascades. Alternatively, if ethics shows stronger vertical diffusion than capacity, this would indicate that international ethical norms (UDHR, ICCPR, UNESCO AI Ethics Recommendation) facilitate North-South knowledge transfer more effectively than implementation practices.

Diffusion analysis tracks when countries first adopted policies scoring above zero on ethics dimensions, examining whether high-income countries function as early adopters whose frameworks subsequently diffuse to developing countries (vertical diffusion) or whether adoption occurs in parallel across income groups through peer learning (horizontal diffusion).

![Regional diffusion heatmap for ethics policies.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/fig_diffusion_heatmap.png){#fig-eth-diffusion-heatmap}

@fig-eth-diffusion visualizes cumulative adoption curves for high-income and developing countries, showing when each group reached critical mass on ethics governance. @fig-eth-first-movers identifies specific early-adopting countries and their timing. @fig-eth-diffusion-heatmap displays regional adoption patterns revealing which regions led ethics governance and which lagged behind.

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| HI median first adoption | 2018 |
| Developing median first adoption | 2020 |
| Adoption lag (HI earlier by) | **1.2 years** ($p = .021$) |
| HI adoption by 2025 | 100% |
| Developing adoption by 2025 | **72%** |
| Diffusion direction | **98% horizontal** |

: Ethics diffusion patterns {#tbl-eth-diffusion}

@tbl-eth-diffusion reveals that **the ethics adoption gap exceeds the capacity gap**, with high-income countries adopting ethics governance 1.2 years earlier than developing countries (p = .021) and achieving universal adoption (100% by 2025) while only 72% of developing countries have adopted any ethics-scored policy. This larger adoption gap contrasts with the smaller quality gap (d = 0.20 for ethics vs. d = 0.30 for capacity), indicating that ethics governance shows greater coverage disparity but smaller sophistication disparity than capacity.

The 72% developing-country adoption rate by 2025 means that **28% of developing countries have produced no policies scoring above zero on any ethics dimension**. These countries either lack AI governance policies entirely or have produced policies addressing AI through purely technical lenses without engaging ethical considerations. This coverage gap proves more consequential than quality gaps because it represents complete absence of ethical frameworks rather than merely lower scores on existing frameworks. Countries without any ethics governance lack foundational principles, rights protections, accountability mechanisms, and stakeholder inclusion processes that could constrain algorithmic harms.

Yet despite this larger adoption gap, **diffusion remains overwhelmingly horizontal (98%)** just as for capacity. Developing countries adopting ethics governance learn primarily from regional peers and countries at similar income levels rather than importing wealthy-country frameworks wholesale. This horizontal pattern proves somewhat surprising for ethics given that international human rights instruments (UDHR, ICCPR, regional conventions) and recent global frameworks (UNESCO AI Ethics Recommendation 2021) establish universal normative foundations that could facilitate vertical diffusion. Apparently, countries find it easier to adapt ethical principles to local contexts when learning from jurisdictions facing similar institutional constraints, political pressures, and resource limitations.

The adoption timing reveals that high-income countries reached critical mass by **2018**, during the peak of international AI ethics enthusiasm following AlphaGo, Cambridge Analytica, and growing awareness of algorithmic bias. Developing countries reached critical mass by **2020**, representing a two-year lag during which international norms diffused through regional organizations, South-South cooperation networks, and technical assistance programs. The 100% high-income adoption versus 72% developing-country adoption by 2025 suggests that this gap may persist: some developing countries may continue indefinitely without explicit ethics governance, treating AI through technocratic optimization frames.

The regional patterns visible in @fig-eth-diffusion-heatmap show that **Sub-Saharan Africa and MENA** demonstrate the lowest adoption rates, with SSA reaching only ~60% adoption by 2025 despite Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda producing sophisticated ethics frameworks. This regional heterogeneity reinforces the within-group variation finding: even regions with multiple ethics governance exemplars contain many countries with no ethics policies whatsoever. The heterogeneity suggests that international and regional technical assistance proves insufficient to ensure universal ethics adoption — countries require domestic political commitment, civil society advocacy, and institutional prioritization that external actors cannot easily generate.

### Efficiency Frontier {#sec-eth-frontier}

The capacity efficiency frontier (@sec-cap-frontier) demonstrated that GDP explains only 3.5% of country-level governance variation, with countries like Rwanda, Kenya, and Brazil achieving implementation readiness far exceeding their GDP-predicted levels. If this pattern extends to ethics, it would reinforce that national wealth proves largely irrelevant for governance sophistication. Alternatively, if ethics shows stronger GDP dependence than capacity, this would suggest that ethical governance requires resources that wealth provides despite the zero GDP effect observed at the policy level.

Efficiency frontier analysis constructs the boundary of maximum ethics governance achievable at each GDP level using Free Disposable Hull (FDH) methodology. Countries on the frontier demonstrate that high ethics scores prove achievable at their wealth levels, while countries below the frontier underperform relative to what their resources enable.

![Over- and under-performer profiles for ethics.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/fig_overunder_profile.png){#fig-eth-overunder}

@fig-eth-frontier plots country-average ethics scores against log GDP per capita with the regression line showing GDP-predicted performance. The wide scatter around the regression line visualizes weak GDP-ethics relationship. @fig-eth-residual ranks countries by their distance from predictions, highlighting dramatic over- and under-performers. @fig-eth-overunder provides dimensional profiles showing where efficiency gains or losses concentrate.

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| OLS $R^2$ (score ~ GDP) | **0.015** |
| Top overperformer | 🇮🇸 Iceland (+0.61) |
| Top underperformer | 🇰🇿 Kazakhstan (−0.56) |
| Frontier countries (FDH) | Uganda → Rwanda → Nigeria → Brazil → Iceland |
| Most efficient (score/$10k GDP) | Rwanda (2.30), Nigeria (1.51) |

: Ethics efficiency frontier results {#tbl-eth-frontier}

@tbl-eth-frontier delivers an even more extreme version of the capacity finding: **GDP explains a mere 1.5% of country-level ethics variation** (R² = 0.015), compared to 3.5% for capacity. This trivial explanatory power represents the chapter's strongest evidence that ethical governance depends fundamentally on political choices rather than economic resources. Knowing a country's GDP provides essentially zero information about its ethics governance quality — wealthy countries span the full ethics spectrum from near-zero to sophisticated frameworks, as do developing countries.

The efficiency frontier's composition proves telling: **Iceland** emerges as the top overall overperformer with a +0.61 residual, demonstrating that small high-income countries can achieve exceptional ethics governance. Iceland's comprehensive frameworks emphasizing rights protection, stakeholder inclusion, and algorithmic accountability substantially exceed what its (already high) GDP would predict. But the frontier also features developing countries achieving remarkable ethics scores despite modest resources: **Uganda**, **Rwanda**, **Nigeria**, and **Brazil** all appear on or near the frontier envelope, demonstrating that sophisticated ethics governance requires political commitment rather than fiscal abundance.

**Rwanda** achieves an efficiency ratio of 2.30 ethics points per $10,000 GDP — more than four times the typical high-income efficiency ratio. Rwanda's comprehensive AI ethics framework emphasizes human rights protection, community inclusion, and accountability mechanisms despite per-capita GDP below $1,000. **Nigeria** similarly demonstrates 1.51 ethics points per $10,000 GDP, with frameworks incorporating indigenous ethical perspectives and emphasizing local stakeholder participation. These frontier cases prove that ethical governance sophistication emerges from *how* political processes unfold rather than *how much* wealth is available.

On the underperformance side, **Kazakhstan** exhibits the largest negative residual (−0.56), scoring dramatically below its GDP-predicted level despite substantial natural resource wealth. This underperformance mirrors Kazakhstan's capacity underperformance, suggesting systematic governance challenges transcending specific dimensions. Other notable underperformers include several wealthy Asian countries that emphasize economic competitiveness and technological advancement over ethical constraints, revealing that wealth provides no guarantee of ethics governance absent political prioritization.

The frontier expansion from capacity to ethics — with Nigeria and Iceland joining the envelope — suggests that ethics governance admits diverse pathways to excellence. Iceland's small-state deliberative democracy enables comprehensive stakeholder consultation producing sophisticated ethics frameworks, while Nigeria's federal structure and vibrant civil society enable indigenous ethical perspectives to inform AI governance. The diversity of frontier countries indicates that no single institutional model or political system monopolizes ethical AI governance.

### Chapter Summary

The ethics dynamics analysis reveals three key contrasts with capacity that fundamentally reshape our understanding of how ethical AI governance evolves globally. First, **convergence exists but through an unexpected mechanism**: high-income countries decline at −0.023 points per year (p = .001) while developing countries show modest non-significant improvement (+0.016/year), producing significant gap narrowing (−0.038 points per year, p = .018). This convergence pattern proves opposite to expectations — rather than developing countries catching up through learning and diffusion, wealthy countries retreat from comprehensive ethics articulation toward technical implementation details. The decline likely reflects governance maturation (regulation replacing aspiration) rather than ethical abandonment, but the convergence mechanism suggests that international ethics norms diffuse more rapidly than implementation capacity.

Second, **adoption gaps exceed quality gaps**: while the ethics quality difference between income groups proves smaller than for capacity (d = 0.20 vs. d = 0.30), the coverage gap proves larger (72% developing-country adoption vs. 100% high-income adoption by 2025). This asymmetry indicates that the critical challenge for global ethics governance involves ensuring universal adoption rather than improving quality among adopters. The 28% of developing countries with zero ethics content represent complete governance voids where no ethical principles, rights protections, or accountability mechanisms constrain AI deployment. Closing these coverage gaps requires addressing why some countries avoid ethics governance entirely despite widespread international norm-setting and technical assistance availability.

Third, **GDP explains even less for ethics than capacity** (R² = 0.015 vs. 0.035), reinforcing that ethical governance depends overwhelmingly on political choices orthogonal to national wealth. Rwanda's 2.30 ethics points per $10,000 GDP efficiency ratio versus typical high-income ratios below 0.50 demonstrates that sophisticated ethics frameworks emerge from deliberate political prioritization of rights protection, stakeholder inclusion, and democratic accountability rather than from fiscal abundance. Iceland, Nigeria, and Brazil join the efficiency frontier through diverse pathways — small-state deliberative democracy, federal civil society engagement, and comprehensive multi-stakeholder processes respectively — proving that no single institutional model monopolizes ethical AI governance.

The common thread connecting these findings: **ethical governance proves achievable at any income level through political commitment**, but **universal adoption requires sustained international attention to coverage gaps** rather than assuming that quality improvements or economic development will automatically generate comprehensive global ethics governance. Development interventions should focus on understanding and addressing why 28% of developing countries maintain ethics governance voids, supporting political processes enabling ethical deliberation in those contexts, and facilitating South-South learning from frontier countries like Rwanda, Kenya, and Brazil that demonstrate ethics governance excellence despite resource constraints.
