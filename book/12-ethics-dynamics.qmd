## Convergence, Diffusion, and the Ethics Frontier {#sec-eth-dynamics}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** Unlike capacity, ethics scores are **converging** across income groups — but the mechanism is surprising: high-income countries are *declining*, not developing countries improving. The efficiency frontier for ethics again features African countries punching above their weight.

### The Convergence Finding {#sec-eth-convergence}

![Ethics convergence trends by income group. The gap is narrowing, driven by HI countries declining.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/robustness/fig_convergence.png){#fig-eth-convergence}

![Dimension-level convergence for ethics.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/robustness/fig_dimension_convergence.png){#fig-eth-dim-convergence}

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Income × Year interaction | $\beta = -0.031$, $p = .015$* |
| HI temporal slope | **−0.023/yr** ($p = .001$) |
| Developing temporal slope | +0.016/yr (n.s.) |
| Gap trend | **Narrowing** (−0.038/yr, $p = .018$) |

: Convergence test for ethics scores {#tbl-eth-convergence}

The ethics convergence result is statistically significant ($p = .015$) but substantively complex:

1. **High-income countries are declining** at −0.023 points per year — a significant downward trend ($p = .001$).
2. **Developing countries show a positive but non-significant trend** (+0.016/yr, n.s.).
3. **The gap is narrowing** at −0.038 points per year.

Why would HI ethics scores decline? Several explanations are plausible:

- **Regulation replacing aspiration**: As countries move from ethics guidelines to binding regulation (e.g., the EU AI Act), the *new* policies may focus on operational requirements rather than ethical principles — scoring higher on capacity but lower on ethics.
- **Ethics fatigue**: The initial wave of ethics documents (2018–2020) was heavy on principles; subsequent policies may have shifted to implementation.
- **Composition effect**: Later HI policies may address more technical or sectoral topics, which naturally score lower on broad ethics dimensions.

### Policy Diffusion {#sec-eth-diffusion}

![Regional diffusion heatmap for ethics policies.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/fig_diffusion_heatmap.png){#fig-eth-diffusion-heatmap}

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| HI median first adoption | 2018 |
| Developing median first adoption | 2020 |
| Adoption lag (HI earlier by) | **1.2 years** ($p = .021$) |
| HI adoption by 2025 | 100% |
| Developing adoption by 2025 | **72%** |
| Diffusion direction | **98% horizontal** |

: Ethics diffusion patterns {#tbl-eth-diffusion}

The ethics adoption gap is **larger** than the capacity gap: by 2025, only 72% of developing countries have adopted any policy with non-zero ethics content, compared to 100% of HI countries and 86% adoption on capacity. This is the one dimension where the income divide is most evident — not in *quality* of ethics governance, but in *coverage*.

### Efficiency Frontier {#sec-eth-frontier}

![Ethics efficiency frontier. GDP explains only 1.5% of country-level ethics variation.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/fig_efficiency_frontier.png){#fig-eth-frontier}

![Residual ranking for ethics: distance from GDP-predicted score.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/fig_residual_ranking.png){#fig-eth-residual}

![Over- and under-performer profiles for ethics.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/fig_overunder_profile.png){#fig-eth-overunder}

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| OLS $R^2$ (score ~ GDP) | **0.015** |
| Top overperformer | 🇮🇸 Iceland (+0.61) |
| Top underperformer | 🇰🇿 Kazakhstan (−0.56) |
| Frontier countries (FDH) | Uganda → Rwanda → Nigeria → Brazil → Iceland |
| Most efficient (score/$10k GDP) | Rwanda (2.30), Nigeria (1.51) |

: Ethics efficiency frontier results {#tbl-eth-frontier}

GDP explains a mere **1.5%** of country-level ethics variation — even less than for capacity (3.5%). The efficiency frontier expands slightly from the capacity frontier: **Nigeria** and **Iceland** join the envelope, alongside the same core of Uganda, Rwanda, and Brazil.

Iceland's presence as a top overperformer is notable — a small high-income country with a remarkably comprehensive ethics framework relative to its (already high) GDP.

### Chapter Summary

The ethics dynamics analysis reveals three key contrasts with capacity:

1. **Convergence exists** — but through HI decline, not developing-country improvement
2. **Adoption gaps are larger** — 28% of developing countries still have no ethics-scored policies
3. **GDP explains even less** — $R^2 = 0.015$ vs. 0.035 for capacity

The common thread: ethical governance is achievable at any income level, but the *coverage* gap (who has any ethics policy at all) may be more consequential than the *quality* gap (how good the policies are).
