## About This Book {.unnumbered}

This book presents the first systematic, large-scale measurement of AI governance **implementation capacity** — the gap between policy aspiration and institutional readiness. Using 2,216 policy documents from the OECD.AI Policy Observatory, spanning 70+ jurisdictions and scored by a three-model LLM ensemble, we ask a deceptively simple question:

> *Do countries have the capacity to implement their AI policies, and how does this vary between high-income and developing countries?*

The answer, it turns out, is more nuanced than the question suggests.

### Structure {.unnumbered}

The book is organised in three parts:

**Part I — AI Governance Capacity** analyses the five implementation dimensions (Clarity, Resources, Authority, Accountability, Coherence) grounded in Mazmanian–Sabatier implementation theory.

**Part II — AI Ethics Governance** examines the five ethics dimensions (Framework Depth, Rights Protection, Governance Mechanisms, Operationalisation, Inclusion) grounded in Jobin et al., UNESCO, and OECD AI Principles.

**Part III — Cross-Cutting Analysis** explores the two-factor structure linking capacity and ethics, and presents comprehensive robustness checks.

### Key Findings at a Glance {.unnumbered}

- **96.5%** of AI policies worldwide score below 2/4 on implementation readiness
- The income-group gap ($d = 0.30$) **vanishes** when controlling for text quality ($d = 0.04$, n.s.)
- Within-group inequality dominates: **98–99%** of variation is *within* income groups, not between them
- GDP explains only **1.5–3.5%** of country-level score variation — GDP is not destiny
- Brazil, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tunisia consistently outperform their GDP-predicted governance levels
- Ethics scores are **converging** across income groups — but driven by high-income countries *declining*, not developing countries improving
- Policy diffusion is **98% horizontal** — peer-to-peer within income groups, not top-down from rich to poor

*"The question is not whether AI will be governed, but whether it will be governed well. That depends on the capacity we build today."*
