## Detailed Regression Output {#sec-appendix-tables}

This appendix provides full regression tables for all models estimated in the book.

### Capacity Models

#### OLS (Model 2 — Full Controls)

See @tbl-cap-ols in @sec-cap-ols for the main results. Full model diagnostics:

- $R^2 = 0.436$, Adjusted $R^2 = 0.434$
- $N = 1{,}949$
- $F$-statistic significant ($p < .001$)
- Residual SE = 0.581

#### Multilevel Random-Intercept Model

See @tbl-cap-multilevel in @sec-cap-multilevel. Additional details:

- Country ICC = 0.091
- Between-country variance ($\sigma^2_u$) = 0.051
- Within-country variance ($\sigma^2_\varepsilon$) = 0.510
- LR test vs. OLS: $\chi^2(1) = 7.30$, $p = .007$

#### Quantile Regression

See @tbl-cap-qr in @sec-cap-quantile. Full coefficient tables available in `data/analysis/paper1_capacity/extended/quantile_results.json`.

#### Tobit Model (Left-Censored at 0)

See @tbl-cap-tobit in @sec-cap-tobit. Additional details:

- Log-likelihood: reported in `tobit_results.json`
- $\sigma = 0.742$
- Censored observations: 27.6%
- Optimiser: multi-method (L-BFGS-B primary)

### Ethics Models

Parallel regression tables for ethics are available in the corresponding JSON files:

- `data/analysis/paper2_ethics/regression_results.json`
- `data/analysis/paper2_ethics/robustness/multilevel_results.json`
- `data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/quantile_results.json`
- `data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/tobit_results.json`

### Sensitivity Table
