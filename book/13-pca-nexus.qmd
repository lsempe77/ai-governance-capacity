## Two Constructs, One Governance Challenge {#sec-pca-nexus}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** Principal component analysis confirms that capacity and ethics are empirically separable but related constructs (two-factor structure, $\alpha$ = 0.92 and 0.91). The capacity–ethics nexus reveals four governance typologies: countries that "walk the walk," those that "talk the talk," and everything in between.

### Are Capacity and Ethics Empirically Distinct? {#sec-pca}

The preceding analyses treated capacity and ethics as conceptually distinct constructs, operationalized through separate five-dimension scoring frameworks. This conceptual distinction aligns with implementation science theory distinguishing *how* policies are structured (capacity) from *what values* they embody (ethics). But conceptual distinction does not guarantee empirical separability — capacity and ethics dimensions could correlate so highly that they collapse into a single underlying "governance quality" factor, making the distinction analytically arbitrary.

Principal component analysis (PCA) tests this empirically by examining whether the ten dimensions (C1-C5, E1-E5) exhibit sufficient independent variation to justify treating capacity and ethics as separate constructs. The analysis reveals a clear two-factor structure (full technical details in @sec-appendix-pca):

![PCA biplot showing the two-component structure. PC1 is a general governance factor; PC2 separates capacity from ethics.](../data/analysis/shared/advanced/fig_pca_biplot.png){#fig-pca-biplot}

**Finding 1: A dominant general governance factor.** The first component (PC1) explains 65.9% of total variance, with all ten dimensions loading positively and roughly equally (loadings 0.26-0.35). This represents "governance quality" as a coherent phenomenon — policies scoring high on any dimension tend to score high on others. Countries that invest in implementation capacity also tend to emphasize ethical commitments, and vice versa.

**Finding 2: A meaningful capacity-ethics separation.** The second component (PC2) explains an additional 12.8% of variance and exhibits striking polarity: capacity dimensions load positively (especially C2 Resources +0.51, C3 Authority +0.29), while ethics dimensions load negatively (especially E2 Rights −0.48, E1 Framework −0.45). This separation coefficient of 0.51 indicates that after controlling for general governance quality, capacity and ethics diverge systematically.

**Finding 3: Excellent internal consistency.** Both subscales demonstrate excellent reliability: Cronbach's α = 0.920 for capacity, α = 0.907 for ethics. This indicates that 92% of capacity variance and 91% of ethics variance reflects true policy differences rather than measurement error, validating the LLM ensemble methodology.

**Substantive interpretation:** The PCA confirms that capacity and ethics are *related but distinct* constructs. They share 66% of their variance (through PC1), explaining the strong correlation documented below. But they retain 13% independent variation (through PC2), providing empirical justification for separate measurement and analysis throughout this book. Development interventions can meaningfully target one construct without necessarily addressing the other, though the correlation suggests that integrated approaches building both simultaneously may prove most effective.

### The Capacity–Ethics Nexus: Strong Correlation, Meaningful Divergence {#sec-nexus}

Having established that capacity and ethics are empirically separable, we now examine how they relate at the policy and country level. Do policies with strong implementation infrastructure also emphasize ethical commitments? Or do capacity and ethics represent competing priorities that trade off against each other?

![Scatter plot of capacity vs. ethics composite scores. The correlation is strong (r = 0.75) but with meaningful dispersion around the diagonal.](../data/analysis/shared/fig_capacity_ethics_scatter.png){#fig-nexus-scatter}

@fig-nexus-scatter visualizes the capacity-ethics relationship through a scatterplot of composite scores, with each point representing one policy. The regression line shows the average relationship, while the scatter around the line reveals heterogeneity. The distribution shows substantial positive correlation but also meaningful dispersion, indicating that while capacity and ethics tend to co-occur, exceptions prove common enough to warrant attention.

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Pearson $r$ | **0.745** |
| Spearman $\rho$ | **0.790** |
| Mean gap (capacity − ethics) | 0.233 |
| % capacity > ethics | 45.5% |
| % ethics > capacity | 20.0% |
| % equal | 34.5% |

: Capacity–ethics correlation and gap {#tbl-nexus}

@tbl-nexus quantifies the capacity-ethics relationship through multiple metrics, revealing both substantial co-occurrence and meaningful divergence. The **Pearson correlation of r = 0.745** indicates strong positive association — policies scoring high on capacity tend strongly toward high ethics scores, and vice versa. The r² = 0.555 indicates that capacity scores explain 55.5% of ethics variance (or equivalently, ethics explains 55.5% of capacity variance), leaving 44.5% of variation independent.

The **Spearman rank correlation of ρ = 0.790** proves even stronger than Pearson, suggesting that the relationship proves robust to outliers and non-linearity. The consistent rankings across capacity and ethics distributions indicate that the association persists throughout the score range rather than being driven by extreme values.

Despite this strong correlation, the **mean gap of 0.233 points** reveals systematic asymmetry: on average, policies score 0.233 points higher on capacity (mean 0.83) than on ethics (mean 0.61). This gap represents roughly 6% of the 4-point scale range, indicating that the typical policy demonstrates modestly stronger implementation infrastructure than ethical substance. The gap suggests that policymakers find it easier or more natural to specify *how* to implement governance (designating authorities, allocating budgets, establishing procedures) than to articulate *what values* should guide governance (ethical frameworks, rights protections, normative commitments).

The directional asymmetry proves even more telling: **45.5% of policies score higher on capacity than ethics**, while only **20.0% show the reverse pattern** (ethics exceeding capacity). The remaining 34.5% show equal scores. This 2.3:1 ratio (capacity-dominant to ethics-dominant) indicates that "walking the walk" (building implementation capacity) proves more common than "talking the talk" (articulating ethical commitments without operational infrastructure). This pattern challenges the "ethics-washing" critique suggesting that organizations produce high-minded ethical principles while avoiding concrete implementation commitments. Our evidence suggests the opposite: policies more often demonstrate operational capacity while leaving ethical foundations underspecified.

The 20% of ethics-dominant policies represent a theoretically interesting subset: frameworks emphasizing rights protection, stakeholder inclusion, and normative principles without corresponding implementation infrastructure. These aspirational documents may serve important norm-setting functions (establishing ethical baselines, building political consensus, signaling commitments to international audiences) despite lacking immediate operational impact. Alternatively, they may represent incomplete governance ecosystems requiring subsequent capacity-building to translate principles into practice.

The strong positive correlation (r = 0.75) combined with meaningful independent variation (44.5% unexplained variance) confirms the PCA finding that capacity and ethics are related but distinct. Development interventions can meaningfully target one construct without necessarily addressing the other, though the correlation suggests that integrated approaches building both simultaneously may prove most effective.

#### Four Quadrants of AI Governance {#sec-quadrants}

Dividing policies at their respective medians (capacity median = 0.60, ethics median = 0.40) creates a four-quadrant typology revealing distinct governance profiles. This classification provides intuitive categories for characterizing policies and countries: those demonstrating strength on both constructs, weakness on both, or strength on one but weakness on the other. The quadrant distribution reveals whether policies cluster on the diagonal (high-high and low-low, suggesting capacity and ethics develop together) or scatter across all quadrants (suggesting independent development).

![The capacity–ethics gap across jurisdictions.](../data/analysis/shared/fig_capacity_ethics_gap.png){#fig-nexus-gap}

@fig-nexus-gap visualizes country-level gaps by plotting capacity minus ethics scores, revealing which jurisdictions emphasize capacity over ethics (positive bars), ethics over capacity (negative bars), or maintain balance (bars near zero). The heterogeneity proves striking — countries span the full range from +0.6 (capacity-dominant) to -0.4 (ethics-dominant), with no income-group clustering apparent.

Dividing policies at their respective medians produces four governance typologies:

| Quadrant | N | % | Description |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| **High–High** | 964 | 45.5% | Walk the walk — strong on both |
| **Low–Low** | 699 | 33.0% | Neither capacity nor ethics |
| **High Cap / Low Eth** | 231 | 10.9% | Operationally capable but ethically thin |
| **Low Cap / High Eth** | 225 | 10.6% | Ethically aspirational but lacking capacity |

: Four quadrants of AI governance {#tbl-quadrants}

@tbl-quadrants reveals that the governance landscape divides roughly into **thirds**: the largest group (45.5%) demonstrates strength on both constructs, a second substantial group (33.0%) shows weakness on both, and smaller but meaningful groups (10.9% and 10.6%) exhibit imbalanced profiles.

**Quadrant 1: "Walk the Walk" (High-High, 45.5%)** — These 964 policies combine sophisticated implementation capacity with comprehensive ethical frameworks. They specify clear objectives, designate responsible authorities, allocate resources, establish accountability mechanisms, and coordinate across agencies (capacity) while simultaneously articulating ethical principles, protecting rights, including stakeholders, and operationalizing normative commitments (ethics). National AI strategies from Canada, France, Singapore, Kenya, and Brazil typically fall into this quadrant, demonstrating that high-high governance proves achievable across income levels. These policies represent the governance ideal — frameworks that both articulate what values should guide AI and specify how to implement governance operationally.

**Quadrant 2: "Neither" (Low-Low, 33.0%)** — These 699 policies score below median on both constructs, representing minimal governance engagement on capacity and ethics alike. Many are brief consultation documents, preliminary notices, or narrow technical standards addressing specific AI applications without comprehensive governance frameworks. Some developing-country policies fall here due to text quality issues (short snippets lacking detail), but many high-income policies also populate this quadrant — sectoral guidelines, procurement standards, or early-stage frameworks preceding more comprehensive governance development. The large size of this quadrant (one-third of policies) underscores the global governance deficit: the modal AI policy worldwide demonstrates limited implementation readiness and minimal ethical substance.

**Quadrant 3: "Operational but Thin" (High Capacity/Low Ethics, 10.9%)** — These 231 policies demonstrate sophisticated implementation infrastructure without corresponding ethical depth. They establish clear authorities, allocate budgets, specify coordination mechanisms, and detail operational procedures (scoring above-median on capacity) while providing minimal ethical frameworks, rights protections, or stakeholder inclusion mechanisms (scoring below-median on ethics). Many binding regulations and sector-specific frameworks fall here, treating AI governance as technical risk management rather than normative deliberation. Some wealthy countries' policies emphasize economic competitiveness and regulatory efficiency while downplaying ethical constraints that might burden industry. This quadrant challenges the "ethics-washing" narrative — these policies "walk the walk" operationally but fail to "talk the talk" ethically.

**Quadrant 4: "Aspirational but Weak" (Low Capacity/High Ethics, 10.6%)** — These 225 policies articulate sophisticated ethical principles, comprehensive rights protections, and extensive stakeholder inclusion commitments (above-median ethics) without corresponding implementation infrastructure (below-median capacity). They emphasize normative frameworks, human rights, democratic accountability, and social justice concerns while leaving authorities unclear, resources unspecified, and coordination mechanisms vague. Some developing-country frameworks fall here, reflecting capacity constraints that make operational implementation difficult despite strong normative commitments. But high-income countries also produce aspirational ethics frameworks lacking implementation teeth, suggesting that ethical articulation proves easier than operational execution regardless of fiscal capacity.

The near-equality of Quadrants 3 (10.9%) and 4 (10.6%) proves theoretically significant: **no systematic sequencing exists** between capacity and ethics development. Policies can build implementation capacity first and add ethical substance later (Quadrant 3 → Quadrant 1), or articulate ethical principles first and develop implementation infrastructure subsequently (Quadrant 4 → Quadrant 1). The evidence contradicts both "build capacity first, ethics later" and "establish ethics first, operationalize later" sequencing models.

This equipoise suggests that effective AI governance interventions can enter through either construct depending on country-specific contexts. Countries with strong rule-of-law traditions and active civil society might naturally articulate ethical frameworks first, requiring subsequent capacity-building to operationalize principles. Countries with strong bureaucratic capacity and technocratic governance cultures might naturally build implementation infrastructure first, requiring subsequent ethical deliberation to ensure that capable institutions serve appropriate values. The quadrant analysis suggests no universal pathway — effective governance requires reaching Quadrant 1 (high-high) through whichever route proves feasible given institutional starting points.
