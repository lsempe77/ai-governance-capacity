## Two Constructs, One Governance Challenge {#sec-pca-nexus}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** Principal component analysis confirms that capacity and ethics are empirically separable but related constructs (two-factor structure, $\alpha$ = 0.92 and 0.91). The capacity–ethics nexus reveals four governance typologies: countries that "walk the walk," those that "talk the talk," and everything in between.

### PCA: Two-Factor Structure {#sec-pca}

We subject all 10 dimension scores (C1–C5, E1–E5) to principal component analysis to test whether capacity and ethics are empirically distinct.

![Scree plot with Kaiser criterion line. Exactly two components have eigenvalues > 1.](../data/analysis/shared/advanced/fig_pca_scree.png){#fig-pca-scree}

| Component | Eigenvalue | Variance | Cumulative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| **PC1** | **6.59** | **65.9%** | 65.9% |
| **PC2** | **1.28** | **12.8%** | 78.6% |
| PC3 | 0.50 | 5.0% | 83.6% |
| PC4 | 0.37 | 3.7% | 87.3% |

: PCA eigenvalues (first 4 of 10 components) {#tbl-pca-eigen}

The Kaiser criterion ($\lambda > 1$) identifies **exactly two components**, explaining 78.6% of total variance.

#### Component Loadings

![PCA biplot showing the two-component structure. PC1 is a general governance factor; PC2 separates capacity from ethics.](../data/analysis/shared/advanced/fig_pca_biplot.png){#fig-pca-biplot}

![Loading patterns for the first two components.](../data/analysis/shared/advanced/fig_pca_loadings.png){#fig-pca-loadings}

| Dimension | PC1 Loading | PC2 Loading |
|:---|---:|---:|
| C1 Clarity | 0.331 | **+0.262** |
| C2 Resources | 0.261 | **+0.505** |
| C3 Authority | 0.330 | **+0.291** |
| C4 Accountability | 0.328 | +0.154 |
| C5 Coherence | 0.348 | +0.058 |
| E1 Framework | 0.306 | **−0.449** |
| E2 Rights | 0.292 | **−0.481** |
| E3 Governance | 0.327 | **−0.343** |
| E4 Operationalisation | 0.328 | +0.088 |
| E5 Inclusion | 0.302 | −0.082 |

: PCA loadings for the first two components {#tbl-pca-loadings}

The loading pattern is clear:

- **PC1 (65.9%)** is a **general governance factor** — all 10 dimensions load positively and roughly equally (range: 0.26–0.35). This captures overall policy quality.
- **PC2 (12.8%)** **separates capacity from ethics** — capacity dimensions (especially C2 Resources) load positively, while ethics dimensions (especially E1 Framework and E2 Rights) load negatively. The separation between capacity and ethics mean loadings is **0.507**.

This two-factor structure empirically validates our theoretical framework: capacity and ethics are related (they share 66% of variance through PC1) but distinct (PC2 captures their divergence).

#### Internal Consistency

| Scale | Cronbach's $\alpha$ | Interpretation |
|:---|---:|:---|
| Capacity (C1–C5) | **0.920** | Excellent |
| Ethics (E1–E5) | **0.907** | Excellent |
| All 10 dimensions | **0.940** | Excellent |

: Cronbach's alpha for the scoring scales {#tbl-cronbach}

Both subscales exhibit excellent internal consistency ($\alpha > 0.90$), confirming that each set of five dimensions reliably measures a coherent construct.

### The Capacity–Ethics Nexus {#sec-nexus}

How do capacity and ethics relate at the policy and country level?

![Scatter plot of capacity vs. ethics composite scores. The correlation is strong ($r = 0.75$) but with meaningful dispersion around the diagonal.](../data/analysis/shared/fig_capacity_ethics_scatter.png){#fig-nexus-scatter}

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Pearson $r$ | **0.745** |
| Spearman $\rho$ | **0.790** |
| Mean gap (capacity − ethics) | 0.233 |
| % capacity > ethics | 45.5% |
| % ethics > capacity | 20.0% |
| % equal | 34.5% |

: Capacity–ethics correlation and gap {#tbl-nexus}

Capacity scores exceed ethics scores for 45.5% of policies, while only 20.0% show the reverse. On average, policies score 0.23 points higher on capacity than on ethics — suggesting a systematic tendency to prioritise institutional architecture over ethical substance.

#### Four Quadrants of AI Governance {#sec-quadrants}

![The capacity–ethics gap across jurisdictions.](../data/analysis/shared/fig_capacity_ethics_gap.png){#fig-nexus-gap}

Dividing policies at their respective medians produces four governance typologies:

| Quadrant | N | % | Description |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| **High–High** | 964 | 45.5% | Walk the walk — strong on both |
| **Low–Low** | 699 | 33.0% | Neither capacity nor ethics |
| **High Cap / Low Eth** | 231 | 10.9% | Operationally capable but ethically thin |
| **Low Cap / High Eth** | 225 | 10.6% | Ethically aspirational but lacking capacity |

: Four quadrants of AI governance {#tbl-quadrants}

The "High Cap / Low Eth" and "Low Cap / High Eth" quadrants are nearly equal in size (~11% each), suggesting no systematic tendency for one to precede the other. Countries can build ethics or capacity first — there is no universal sequencing.
