## The Global Landscape of AI Ethics Governance {#sec-eth-landscape}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** This chapter mirrors the capacity landscape analysis for the five ethics dimensions. Ethics governance lags behind implementation capacity (mean 0.61 vs. 0.83), and 36.3% of all policies score exactly zero on ethics operationalisation.

### Overall Score Distribution {#sec-eth-distribution}

The global landscape of AI ethics governance reveals a troubling pattern: policies worldwide prove substantially weaker on ethical principles than on implementation capacity. While capacity scores average 0.83 across the 2,216-policy corpus, ethics scores average just 0.61 — a gap of 0.22 points representing roughly one-fifth of the scale range. This disparity suggests that policymakers find it easier to specify implementation mechanisms (budgets, agencies, coordination procedures) than to articulate and operationalize ethical commitments. The floor effects visible in @fig-eth-distributions prove even more severe than for capacity, indicating that many policies contain minimal or zero ethical content despite addressing AI governance explicitly.

The distribution's right skew indicates that while a minority of policies demonstrate sophisticated ethics governance, the modal policy contains almost no ethical content. This creates a governance landscape where technical implementation details dominate and ethical principles remain aspirational rather than operationalized.

![Distribution of ethics dimension scores across 2,216 policies. Floor effects are even more pronounced than for capacity.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_distributions.png){#fig-eth-distributions}

The ethics composite score averages **0.61/4.00** (SD = 0.62) — meaningfully lower than the capacity composite (0.83):

| Dimension | Mean | SD | Median |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| E1 Ethical Framework Depth | 0.67 | 0.75 | 0.00 |
| E2 Rights Protection | 0.55 | 0.66 | 0.00 |
| E3 Governance Mechanisms | 0.62 | 0.74 | 0.00 |
| E4 Operationalisation | 0.59 | 0.73 | 0.00 |
| E5 Inclusion & Participation | 0.65 | 0.73 | 0.00 |
| **Ethics composite** | **0.61** | **0.62** | **0.40** |

: Ethics dimension descriptive statistics {#tbl-eth-descriptives}

@tbl-eth-descriptives reveals several patterns distinguishing ethics from capacity governance. First, the median score of **0.40** falls well below the 2.00 scale midpoint, indicating that more than half of all policies demonstrate minimal ethical engagement. This contrasts with capacity's median of 0.60, suggesting that ethical principles prove more difficult to incorporate than implementation procedures. Second and more dramatically, **36.3% of all policies score exactly zero** on ethics compared to 27.6% for capacity. More than one-third of the corpus contains no discernible ethical content whatsoever — no rights protections, no stakeholder inclusion mechanisms, no governance frameworks, no operationalized principles.

This pervasive floor effect admits several interpretations. Many policies may address narrow technical or sectoral issues (data labeling standards, procurement requirements) where ethical principles seem irrelevant to drafters. Alternatively, policymakers may deliberately avoid ethical commitments that could constrain technological development or create enforcement burdens. Or the floor effect may reflect institutional capacity constraints — developing ethical frameworks requires normative expertise, stakeholder consultation, and political consensus that many jurisdictions lack.

The dimension-level means show surprisingly little variation (0.55 to 0.67), unlike capacity where Resources (1.15) and Accountability (0.52) diverge dramatically. Ethics governance appears uniformly weak across all five dimensions rather than showing selective strength in particular areas. **E2 Rights Protection** scores lowest (0.55), indicating that even fundamental human rights protections remain absent from many AI policies. **E1 Ethical Framework Depth** scores highest (0.67) but still falls far below the scale midpoint, suggesting that even policies citing ethical principles rarely develop them beyond superficial invocations.

The global AI policy landscape thus proves better at specifying *how* to implement governance (capacity) than at articulating *what ethical standards* to govern by (ethics). This asymmetry carries significant implications: without ethical foundations, even sophisticated implementation infrastructure may serve technocratic efficiency rather than human rights protection or social justice.

### Income-Group Comparisons {#sec-eth-income}

The modest capacity gap between high-income and developing countries (d = 0.30) suggested that implementation readiness depends less on national wealth than conventional wisdom assumes. Ethics governance reveals an even more dramatic pattern: the income-group gap proves **even smaller** than for capacity, suggesting that ethical commitments are genuinely achievable regardless of fiscal constraints. If capacity requires budgets, agencies, and technical expertise that wealth facilitates, ethical governance requires political will, normative clarity, and institutional commitment that prove orthogonal to GDP.

This finding challenges a pervasive development narrative positioning ethics governance as a "luxury" that developing countries can address only after achieving economic growth. The evidence suggests otherwise: articulating rights protections, including stakeholders, and operationalizing ethical principles prove no more difficult for poor countries than for wealthy ones — and possibly easier, given that developing countries face fewer entrenched corporate interests resisting governance constraints.

![Violin plots of ethics scores by income group. The distributions overlap even more than for capacity.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_income_violins.png){#fig-eth-income-violins}

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| HI mean (N = 1,700) | 0.62 |
| Developing mean (N = 397) | 0.50 |
| Welch's $t$ | 3.55 |
| $p$-value | < .001 |
| Cohen's $d$ | **0.20** |

: Income-group ethics comparison {#tbl-eth-income}

@tbl-eth-income quantifies what @fig-eth-income-violins visualizes: the ethics gap proves remarkably small. Cohen's d = 0.20 falls comfortably within the "small effect" threshold (d < 0.30) used across psychological and social sciences, and represents an even smaller gap than capacity's d = 0.30. The high-income mean (0.62) exceeds the developing-country mean (0.50) by just 0.12 points on a 4-point scale — roughly 3% of the possible score range. Given the standard deviations (0.62 for the full sample), this difference reflects only one-fifth of a standard deviation, indicating extensive distributional overlap.

More fundamentally, this gap **vanishes entirely** when analyses restrict to good-quality policy texts (d = -0.09, non-significant; see @sec-robustness). The apparent income advantage thus reflects documentation quality rather than genuine ethical governance differences. Developing countries with well-documented policies demonstrate ethics scores statistically indistinguishable from — or slightly exceeding — high-income countries with equivalent text quality. This robustness finding suggests that the raw gap in @tbl-eth-income constitutes a measurement artifact: wealthy countries tend to produce longer, more detailed policy documents that provide more opportunities for our LLM scoring ensemble to detect ethical content, but conditional on text quality, ethical sophistication proves unrelated to GDP.

The implications prove far-reaching: if ethics governance requires neither fiscal resources nor technical infrastructure that wealth provides, development interventions need not prioritize economic growth before addressing ethical AI governance. Countries can build rights-protective, participatory, accountable AI governance frameworks immediately using existing institutional capacity.

#### Dimension-Level Gaps

![Boxplots of ethics scores by income group across all five dimensions.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_income_boxplot.png){#fig-eth-income-boxplot}

| Dimension | HI Mean | Dev Mean | Diff | $d$ | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| E1 Framework | 0.68 | 0.58 | 0.10 | 0.13 | .024 |
| E2 Rights | 0.55 | 0.47 | 0.08 | 0.11 | .053 |
| E3 Governance | 0.63 | 0.50 | 0.13 | **0.19** | < .001 |
| E4 Operationalisation | 0.61 | 0.43 | 0.17 | **0.25** | < .001 |
| E5 Inclusion | 0.64 | 0.51 | 0.13 | 0.18 | .002 |

: Dimension-level income gaps for ethics {#tbl-eth-dim-gaps}

@tbl-eth-dim-gaps disaggregates the modest overall ethics gap into dimension-specific patterns that reveal where income differences concentrate. The largest gap appears in **Operationalisation (E4)** (d = 0.25, p < .001), indicating that high-income countries prove somewhat more successful at translating abstract ethical principles into concrete policy requirements. This makes theoretical sense: operationalization requires detailed specification of compliance mechanisms, monitoring procedures, and enforcement protocols that demand technical expertise and institutional capacity. Converting "fairness" or "transparency" from aspirational principles to measurable requirements requires legal sophistication, algorithmic auditing capabilities, and administrative infrastructure that wealth may facilitate.

Conversely, the smallest gap appears in **Rights Protection (E2)** (d = 0.11, p = .053 marginally significant), suggesting that rights language proves relatively universal across income groups. Developing and wealthy countries alike invoke privacy rights, non-discrimination protections, due process guarantees, and human dignity safeguards with similar frequency and sophistication. This universality likely reflects decades of international human rights law establishing common language and normative expectations that transcend income differences. Countries can invoke UDHR Article 12 (privacy), ICCPR Article 26 (non-discrimination), or regional human rights frameworks without requiring substantial wealth.

The intermediate gaps in **E1 Framework Depth** (d = 0.13), **E3 Governance Mechanisms** (d = 0.19), and **E5 Inclusion** (d = 0.18) all remain within the small-effect range, indicating that high-income advantages prove modest across all dimensions. Even where statistically significant, these gaps represent differences of 0.08-0.17 points on 4-point scales — substantively negligible margins suggesting near-parity in ethical governance capacity.

The dimension-level pattern thus suggests that income matters modestly for technical operationalization but proves largely irrelevant for normative commitments like rights protection, stakeholder inclusion, and ethical framework articulation. Development interventions might therefore focus on operationalization support (model audit tools, algorithmic impact assessment templates, enforcement guidance) rather than on ethical principle development, where developing countries already demonstrate sophistication.

### Regional Patterns {#sec-eth-regional}

The weak relationship between national income and ethics governance raises a natural question: if GDP proves largely irrelevant, do regional patterns or shared institutional traditions explain variation in ethical AI governance? Regional analysis tests whether geographic proximity, shared legal systems, colonial histories, or policy networks create identifiable ethics governance clusters. Strong regional patterns would suggest that policy diffusion occurs primarily through geographic neighbors or regional organizations, while weak patterns would indicate that ethical governance choices reflect country-specific political and institutional factors operating independently of regional context.

![Regional heatmap for ethics scores. Regional variation is less pronounced than for capacity.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_region_heatmap.png){#fig-eth-region-heatmap}

@fig-eth-region-heatmap reveals that regional variation proves **less pronounced for ethics than for capacity**, with most regions clustering near the global mean of 0.61. Unlike capacity, where North America and Europe demonstrated clear advantages and Sub-Saharan Africa showed systematic weakness, ethics scores show greater regional homogeneity. North America (mean 0.67) and Europe (0.64) exhibit modest advantages over the global average, but these differences prove smaller than for capacity. Latin America and the Caribbean (0.59) approaches the global mean, while Sub-Saharan Africa (0.53) shows somewhat lower scores but not the dramatic gap observed for capacity.

This regional convergence supports the dimension-level finding that ethical governance depends less on institutional infrastructure (which varies sharply by region) than on normative commitments (which prove more universally distributed). Regions cannot easily "buy" sophisticated ethics frameworks through economic development alone — they require political choices to prioritize rights protection, stakeholder inclusion, and ethical operationalization. Some wealthy regions (East Asia) show surprisingly modest ethics scores despite high GDP, while some developing regions (LAC) demonstrate ethics governance approaching high-income levels.

The modest regional variation also suggests that the regional organizations and policy networks facilitating capacity diffusion (EU coordination, African Union technical assistance) prove less consequential for ethics governance. Countries apparently develop ethical frameworks based on domestic political traditions, civil society pressure, and normative commitments rather than importing regional model frameworks.

### Policy-Type Variation {#sec-eth-policy-type}

Just as implementation capacity varies systematically by policy instrument (binding regulation vs. guidance), ethical content likely varies by policy type. Aspirational strategies and principles documents may emphasize ethical frameworks while downplaying implementation details, whereas binding regulations may focus on compliance requirements while treating ethics as implicit background assumptions. Testing whether different policy instruments exhibit distinct ethics profiles reveals which governance approaches prove most effective at incorporating ethical commitments.

![Ethics scores by policy type.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_policy_type.png){#fig-eth-policy-type}

@fig-eth-policy-type demonstrates that **strategies and frameworks** achieve the highest average ethics scores (mean approximately 0.75), followed by **binding regulations** (0.62), with **guidance documents** trailing (0.55). This pattern differs somewhat from capacity, where binding regulation scored highest. The finding makes intuitive sense: strategies and AI ethics frameworks explicitly aim to articulate normative commitments, stakeholder values, and rights protections as their primary purpose. These documents function as vehicles for public deliberation about what values should guide AI governance, naturally producing rich ethical content.

Binding regulations, while scoring moderately on ethics (0.62), focus predominantly on compliance requirements, enforcement mechanisms, and operational specifications — producing higher capacity scores but somewhat lower ethics scores. Many regulations assume ethical premises implicitly ("systems shall not discriminate," "users have right to explanation") without developing ethical foundations comprehensively. The technical-legal style of binding instruments may also discourage extensive normative discussion that scores highly on ethics dimensions.

Guidance documents show the lowest ethics scores (0.55), likely because they address narrow technical or sectoral issues (procurement guidelines, data labeling standards) where ethical principles seem tangential. Organizations producing guidance may assume that broader ethical frameworks already exist, focusing instead on operational implementation within those assumed ethical boundaries.

This policy-type variation suggests that comprehensive AI governance ecosystems require **layered architectures**: aspirational strategies establishing ethical foundations, binding regulations operationalizing those principles into enforceable requirements, and technical guidance supporting implementation. Countries relying solely on binding regulation without foundational ethics documents may achieve implementation capacity while leaving normative commitments underspecified.

### Temporal Trends {#sec-eth-temporal}

The cross-sectional patterns documented above describe the current state of global ethics governance but cannot reveal whether ethical sophistication is improving, declining, or remaining stable over time. Temporal trend analysis addresses this gap by examining how ethics scores evolved from the earliest AI policies in 2017 through the 2025 corpus snapshot. If ethics scores are rising, this would suggest that policymakers increasingly recognize ethical dimensions as central to AI governance. If scores are falling, this might indicate "ethics fatigue" or a shift from aspirational principles to technical implementation. Stable trends would suggest that ethical engagement remains constant despite dramatic growth in policy volume.

![Temporal trend in ethics scores (2017–2025).](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_temporal_trend.png){#fig-eth-temporal}

@fig-eth-temporal reveals a surprising pattern: overall ethics scores show modest decline from 2017 to 2025, with particularly sharp drops in high-income countries (examined in detail in @sec-eth-dynamics). The early policy wave (2017-2019) emphasized ethical principles, rights protections, and stakeholder inclusion, producing relatively high ethics scores. Many foundational documents from this period — including landmark strategies from Canada, France, and Germany — functioned as normative deliberations about AI's societal implications, naturally scoring high on ethics dimensions.

By contrast, the 2020-2025 period shows proliferation of more technical and sectoral policies addressing specific implementation challenges: procurement standards, algorithmic auditing requirements, sector-specific guidelines. These policies assume ethical foundations established by earlier frameworks and focus instead on operational details, producing higher capacity scores but lower ethics scores. The EU AI Act (2024) exemplifies this pattern: its risk-based regulatory approach scores very high on capacity dimensions (clear authorities, detailed requirements, enforcement mechanisms) but somewhat lower on ethics (assuming rather than articulating ethical foundations).

The temporal decline thus likely reflects **governance maturation** rather than ethical regression. As AI governance ecosystems develop, countries may deliberately shift from aspirational principles to binding implementation mechanisms, treating ethical foundations as settled and focusing on operationalization. This interpretation gains support from @sec-eth-dynamics, which shows that high-income countries — those with the most mature governance systems — exhibit the strongest declining trends. The apparent "ethics decline" may actually indicate governance sophistication: having established ethical frameworks in earlier policies, countries now develop implementation infrastructure within those frameworks.

### Correlation Structure {#sec-eth-correlations}

The five ethics dimensions were designed to capture conceptually distinct aspects of ethical AI governance: normative frameworks (E1), rights protections (E2), accountability mechanisms (E3), operational specifications (E4), and stakeholder inclusion (E5). But conceptual distinction does not guarantee empirical independence — dimensions could correlate highly if policies tend to adopt comprehensive ethical approaches or omit ethics entirely. Examining the correlation structure reveals whether the dimensional framework identifies genuinely separable governance components or merely reflects a single underlying "ethics engagement" factor.

![Correlation matrix for the five ethics dimensions.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_correlations.png){#fig-eth-correlations}

@fig-eth-correlations shows that ethics dimensions exhibit moderate-to-strong positive correlations, with all pairwise coefficients exceeding r = 0.40. The strongest correlations appear between **E1 Framework Depth** and **E4 Operationalisation** (r ≈ 0.72), indicating that policies articulating sophisticated ethical frameworks tend also to operationalize those principles into concrete requirements. This makes theoretical sense: developing detailed ethical frameworks without operationalizing them produces aspirational documents, while operationalizing principles without articulating frameworks produces technically proficient but normatively hollow governance. Effective ethics governance apparently requires both conceptual depth and operational specificity together.

Similarly, **E3 Governance Mechanisms** and **E5 Inclusion** correlate strongly (r ≈ 0.68), suggesting that policies establishing accountability structures also tend to include stakeholders in governance processes. This alignment reflects a broader democratic accountability logic: governance mechanisms lacking stakeholder input risk producing technocratic solutions disconnected from affected communities, while stakeholder inclusion without governance mechanisms risks empty consultation exercises that cannot translate participation into policy influence.

Despite these substantial correlations, the dimensions prove empirically separable rather than collapsing into a single factor. The correlations, while positive and significant, remain well below 1.0, indicating that policies can score high on some dimensions while scoring low on others. The PCA analysis in @sec-pca-nexus confirms that capacity and ethics, while correlated at r = 0.75, constitute empirically distinct constructs. Policies can demonstrate sophisticated implementation capacity while showing minimal ethical engagement, or vice versa. The dimensional framework thus captures meaningful variation in ethical governance approaches rather than merely distinguishing "high ethics" from "low ethics" policies.
