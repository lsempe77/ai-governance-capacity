## GDP Has Zero Effect on Ethics {#sec-eth-determinants}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** This chapter presents the most striking asymmetry between capacity and ethics: while GDP has a modest positive effect on capacity, it has **zero effect on ethics scores across all quantiles**. The OLS significance is entirely driven by the extensive margin (whether any policy exists).

### OLS Regression {#sec-eth-ols}

The capacity determinants analysis in @sec-cap-determinants revealed that GDP exerts a modest but genuine effect on implementation readiness, particularly on Resources dimensions requiring fiscal capacity. If that pattern extends to ethics, we would expect wealthier countries to demonstrate stronger ethical frameworks, more comprehensive rights protections, and more sophisticated operationalization. This expectation reflects a common development narrative positioning ethics governance as a "luxury good" that countries can afford only after achieving economic security. Alternatively, if ethics governance depends primarily on political will and normative commitments rather than fiscal resources, GDP should prove irrelevant or weakly related to ethics scores.

The OLS regression tests this hypothesis by modeling ethics composite scores as a function of log GDP per capita, controlling for text quality and other policy characteristics. The headline question is whether the GDP coefficient proves positive and significant, indicating that national wealth facilitates ethical governance.

![Scatter plot of ethics scores against log GDP per capita.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_gdp_scatter.png){#fig-eth-gdp-scatter}

@fig-eth-gdp-scatter visualizes the GDP-ethics relationship, showing a weak positive association with substantial scatter. The regression quantifies this pattern:

The OLS model for ethics produces a nominally significant GDP coefficient:

| Variable | $\beta$ | SE | $t$ | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| log(GDP pc) | 0.061 | 0.020 | 3.05 | .002 |
| Good text quality | 1.014 | — | — | < .001 |

: OLS regression for ethics (selected coefficients) {#tbl-eth-ols}

@tbl-eth-ols shows a GDP coefficient of β = 0.061 (p = .002), suggesting that each one-unit increase in log GDP per capita associates with a 0.061-point increase in ethics scores. This coefficient proves statistically significant and apparently supports the "luxury good" hypothesis. However, as the quantile regression analysis below reveals, this apparent significance constitutes a statistical mirage arising from model misspecification.

The text quality coefficient (β = 1.014, p < .001) again dominates, indicating that documentation quality explains far more ethics variation than national wealth. Well-documented policies score roughly one full point higher on the 4-point ethics scale than poorly documented policies with equivalent GDP. This finding mirrors the capacity results and reinforces that measurement quality proves fundamental to valid cross-country comparisons.

But the OLS framework makes a critical assumption: that GDP's effect proves constant across the entire ethics distribution. If GDP affects primarily whether countries produce any ethics content (the extensive margin) rather than how sophisticated that content becomes (the intensive margin), OLS coefficients will mislead. The zero-inflation visible in @fig-eth-gdp-scatter — with 36.3% of policies scoring exactly zero — suggests that the GDP effect may operate primarily by reducing the probability of zero scores rather than by improving positive scores. Quantile regression tests this hypothesis directly.

### Quantile Regression: The Zero-Effect Finding {#sec-eth-quantile}

Quantile regression estimates GDP's effect at different points in the ethics score distribution rather than assuming a constant effect. If GDP genuinely facilitates ethical governance throughout the distribution, we should observe positive coefficients at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. If GDP affects only the extensive margin (whether any ethics content exists), coefficients should prove significant only at low quantiles where zero-scoring policies concentrate. If GDP proves irrelevant conditional on having any ethics content, coefficients should approach zero at all positive-score quantiles.

![Quantile regression coefficients for GDP across the ethics distribution. GDP has **zero effect** at every quantile — a flat line at β = 0.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_quantile_regression.png){#fig-eth-qr}

@fig-eth-qr delivers this chapter's central empirical finding: the quantile regression line remains **perfectly flat at β ≈ 0** across the entire distribution. This flatness indicates that GDP exerts no effect on ethics scores at any quantile, contradicting the OLS result completely.

| Quantile ($\tau$) | GDP $\beta$ | SE | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| 0.25 (positive subset) | 0.000 | — | n.s. |
| 0.50 | 0.000 | — | n.s. |
| 0.75 | 0.000 | — | n.s. |
| OLS (reference) | 0.061 | 0.020 | .002 |

: Quantile regression: GDP effect across the ethics distribution {#tbl-eth-qr}

@tbl-eth-qr quantifies what @fig-eth-qr visualizes: **GDP has exactly zero effect on ethics scores at every quantile** examined. At the 25th percentile (policies just above the zero threshold), GDP β = 0.000, non-significant. At the median (50th percentile), GDP β = 0.000, non-significant. At the 75th percentile (relatively sophisticated ethics governance), GDP β = 0.000, non-significant. The table includes the OLS coefficient (β = 0.061, p = .002) as reference, highlighting the dramatic discrepancy between average effects and conditional effects.

This zero-effect finding carries profound theoretical and practical implications. The OLS significance (β = 0.061, p = .002) arises entirely from the **extensive margin** — wealthier countries produce more policies overall, and producing more policies increases the probability that at least one will contain ethics content. This mechanical relationship between policy volume and ethics coverage creates spurious correlation between GDP and ethics scores in OLS regressions that pool zero and positive scores. But **conditional on having a non-zero ethics score**, GDP contributes nothing to governance quality.

The finding directly contradicts the "luxury good" hypothesis positioning ethical governance as achievable only after economic development. Countries at any income level can — and demonstrably do — produce policies with sophisticated ethics frameworks, comprehensive rights protections, robust governance mechanisms, detailed operationalization, and extensive stakeholder inclusion. Kenya's AI and Data Protection regulations, Brazil's AI Ethics Framework, and Colombia's comprehensive AI strategy all demonstrate high ethics scores despite per-capita GDPs well below high-income thresholds. Conversely, several wealthy countries produce ethics-light policies focusing primarily on technical implementation details.

This zero-effect pattern contrasts sharply with capacity determinants (@sec-cap-determinants), where GDP shows modest positive effects particularly on Resources dimensions. The asymmetry makes theoretical sense: implementation capacity requires fiscal resources, technical expertise, and administrative infrastructure that wealth facilitates, while ethical commitment requires political will, normative clarity, and stakeholder engagement that prove orthogonal to GDP. Countries cannot easily "buy" sophisticated ethics governance through economic growth — they must make deliberate political choices to prioritize rights protection, inclusion, and ethical operationalization.

The policy implications prove far-reaching: development interventions promoting ethical AI governance need not wait for economic growth or assume that wealthy-country models will automatically diffuse to developing nations as they grow richer. Instead, effective interventions should support political processes enabling ethical deliberation, strengthen civil society organizations advocating for rights protections, and provide technical assistance on operationalization regardless of national income levels.

### Multilevel Model {#sec-eth-multilevel}

The quantile regression demonstrated that GDP's apparent effect operates entirely through the extensive margin, but that analysis treats all policies as independent observations. Multilevel modeling addresses this limitation by properly accounting for the nested structure of policies within countries. If multiple policies from the same country tend to score similarly due to shared institutional contexts, political traditions, or policy ecosystems, standard errors will be biased downward and statistical significance inflated. The multilevel model corrects this bias by estimating country-level random effects and partitioning variance into within-country and between-country components.

The key parameter is the **Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)**, which quantifies what proportion of total ethics variation occurs between countries versus within countries. A high ICC (approaching 1.0) would indicate that country membership strongly determines ethics scores, suggesting that national-level factors like GDP, regime type, or legal traditions dominate. A low ICC (approaching 0.0) would indicate that within-country variation dominates, suggesting that policy-specific factors like document type, sector focus, or authoring agency matter more than country identity.

![Country random effects from the multilevel ethics model.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/robustness/fig_country_random_effects.png){#fig-eth-re}

@fig-eth-re visualizes country random effects, showing the extent to which countries deviate from the overall mean after controlling for GDP and text quality. Countries with large positive random effects (Iceland, Rwanda, Nigeria) consistently produce higher-ethics policies than their GDP predicts, while countries with large negative random effects (Kazakhstan, several wealthy Asian countries) consistently underperform.

| Metric | OLS | Mixed |
|:---|---:|---:|
| GDP $\beta$ | 0.061 | 0.029 |
| GDP $p$ | .002 | .38 |
| Country ICC | — | **0.125** |

: Multilevel model comparison for ethics {#tbl-eth-multilevel}

@tbl-eth-multilevel reveals two critical findings about country-level nesting in ethics governance. First, the GDP coefficient collapses from β = 0.061 (p = .002) in OLS to β = 0.029 (p = .38) in the multilevel model — a 52% reduction in magnitude and complete loss of statistical significance. This collapse occurs because the multilevel model properly attributes correlation among policies from the same country to country random effects rather than spuriously attributing it to GDP. When countries with high GDP also happen to produce multiple high-ethics policies, OLS incorrectly attributes this correlation to GDP directly, while multilevel modeling correctly recognizes that unobserved country characteristics (political culture, institutional traditions, civil society strength) drive the pattern.

Second, the country ICC = 0.125 indicates that **12.5% of ethics variation occurs between countries** while **87.5% occurs within countries**. This ICC proves modestly higher than capacity's ICC = 0.091, suggesting that country-level factors explain somewhat more variation in ethics than in capacity. Yet even for ethics, within-country heterogeneity dominates overwhelmingly. Countries produce diverse ethics profiles across their policy portfolios rather than maintaining consistent ethical approaches. A country might produce a sophisticated national AI strategy scoring high on all ethics dimensions alongside sector-specific regulations scoring near-zero because they focus narrowly on technical requirements.

The 12.5% between-country variance also means that **87.5% of ethics variation cannot be explained by any country-level predictor** including GDP, regime type, legal tradition, or regional membership. This massive within-country variation implies that policy-specific factors — document purpose, authoring agency, stakeholder consultation processes, political timing — matter far more than national characteristics. Development interventions should therefore target policy development processes within countries rather than assuming that improving country-level conditions (economic growth, democratic institutions) will automatically generate better ethics governance.

The random effects plot in @fig-eth-re identifies specific countries whose consistent over- or under-performance suggests that national political choices do matter, even if they explain only 12.5% of total variation. Iceland, Rwanda, and Nigeria all show large positive random effects, indicating sustained commitment to ethical AI governance exceeding their GDP-predicted levels. These countries provide concrete examples that ethical governance sophistication emerges from political prioritization rather than economic capacity.

### Tobit Regression {#sec-eth-tobit}

The 36.3% zero-score rate for ethics exceeds capacity's 27.6% floor effect, indicating more severe censoring at the scale minimum. Standard OLS and even quantile regression may produce biased estimates when more than one-third of observations cluster at the scale floor, because these methods treat zero as just another point on the continuum rather than recognizing it as a censored value. Many zero-scoring policies likely would score below zero if the scale extended into negative territory — they represent not "minimal ethics" but "complete absence of ethics consideration." Tobit regression explicitly models this censoring mechanism by estimating a latent continuous ethics propensity that becomes censored at zero for observed scores.

The Tobit model thus provides censoring-corrected coefficient estimates revealing GDP's effect on the underlying latent ethics propensity rather than just on observed scores.

![Comparison of OLS and Tobit coefficients for the ethics model.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_tobit_comparison.png){#fig-eth-tobit}

@fig-eth-tobit visualizes how censoring correction affects coefficient estimates, with Tobit estimates typically larger in magnitude than OLS due to unfolding the censored distribution.

| Variable | OLS $\beta$ | Tobit $\beta$ |
|:---|---:|---:|
| log(GDP pc) | 0.061 | 0.100 |
| Good text quality | — | 1.014 |
| $\sigma$ | — | 0.700 |
| P(uncensored at mean) | — | 0.725 |
| Floor: score = 0 | 36.3% | — |

: Tobit model for ethics {#tbl-eth-tobit}

@tbl-eth-tobit shows that censoring correction increases the GDP coefficient from β = 0.061 (OLS) to β = 0.100 (Tobit) — a 64% increase reflecting that the severe floor effect attenuates OLS estimates. The Tobit coefficient suggests that GDP's effect on the latent ethics propensity proves somewhat larger than OLS indicates. However, this larger Tobit coefficient must be interpreted in light of the quantile regression finding: the effect operates entirely through the extensive margin (reducing probability of zero scores) rather than improving positive scores.

The model estimates that at mean covariate values, P(uncensored) = 0.725, meaning 72.5% of policies score above zero while 27.5% remain censored at zero. This censoring probability varies systematically with GDP: wealthy countries show lower censoring probabilities (more likely to produce any ethics content), while developing countries show higher censoring probabilities. But crucially, **conditional on being uncensored** (scoring above zero), GDP contributes nothing to ethics quality — exactly as quantile regression demonstrated.

The text quality effect again dominates (β = 1.014), indicating that documentation quality explains far more variation than GDP even after censoring correction. The error variance σ = 0.700 quantifies the substantial residual variation unexplained by GDP and text quality combined, reinforcing that policy-specific factors rather than country-level wealth drive ethics governance variation.

### Synthesis {#sec-eth-determinants-synthesis}

The ethics determinants analysis converges on a clear and consequential headline finding: **GDP does not buy better ethics governance**. This conclusion emerges consistently across four complementary modeling approaches. The OLS regression initially suggested a modest GDP effect (β = 0.061, p = .002), but quantile regression revealed this effect as entirely spurious — GDP shows exactly zero effect at every quantile of the positive-score distribution. The multilevel model reinforced this finding by demonstrating that proper accounting for country-level nesting eliminates the GDP coefficient entirely (β = 0.029, p = .38). The Tobit model showed that even after correcting for severe floor censoring, GDP's effect operates exclusively through the extensive margin (whether any ethics content exists) rather than the intensive margin (how sophisticated that content becomes).

This zero-effect finding contrasts sharply with capacity determinants, where GDP exerts modest but genuine positive effects particularly on Resources dimensions requiring fiscal infrastructure. The asymmetry makes profound theoretical sense: implementation capacity (budgets, agencies, legal authorities, coordination mechanisms) scales with economic resources and administrative infrastructure that wealth provides. Wealthy countries can hire more civil servants, fund larger regulatory agencies, and deploy sophisticated monitoring technologies. Ethical governance (rights protections, stakeholder inclusion, normative frameworks, accountability commitments) depends instead on political will, democratic traditions, civil society strength, and institutional culture — factors orthogonal to GDP.

The finding directly undermines a pervasive development narrative positioning ethics governance as a "luxury good" requiring economic security before adoption. This narrative appears frequently in policy discussions suggesting that developing countries should prioritize economic growth and basic service delivery before investing in AI ethics frameworks. Our evidence says otherwise: countries at any income level demonstrate capacity for sophisticated ethical governance when political leaders, civil society organizations, and institutional actors prioritize rights protection and democratic accountability. Kenya's comprehensive data protection and AI governance frameworks, Colombia's detailed national AI strategy emphasizing human rights, Brazil's sophisticated ethics deliberation processes, and Rwanda's inclusion-focused policies all demonstrate that ethical governance sophistication emerges from political choices rather than fiscal capacity.

Conversely, several wealthy countries produce ethics-light policies focusing narrowly on technical compliance requirements without comprehensive rights protections or meaningful stakeholder inclusion. Kazakhstan's substantial natural resource wealth fails to generate sophisticated ethics governance, while several high-income Asian countries emphasize economic competitiveness over ethical constraints. These cases prove that wealth provides no guarantee of ethical governance absent institutional prioritization and political commitment.

The policy implications prove far-reaching for development interventions and international technical assistance. Rather than assuming that ethical AI governance will emerge automatically as countries develop economically, or that wealthy-country ethics models should be transplanted wholesale to developing nations, effective interventions should support political processes enabling ethical deliberation regardless of income levels. This might include strengthening civil society organizations advocating for rights protections, facilitating multi-stakeholder consultation processes, providing technical assistance on operationalizing ethical principles into enforceable requirements, and showcasing examples of developing countries achieving ethics governance sophistication despite resource constraints. The evidence suggests that development practitioners should treat ethical AI governance as immediately achievable for all countries rather than as aspirational goals requiring prior economic development.
