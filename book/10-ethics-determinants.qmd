## GDP Has Zero Effect on Ethics {#sec-eth-determinants}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** This chapter presents the most striking asymmetry between capacity and ethics: while GDP has a modest positive effect on capacity, it has **zero effect on ethics scores across all quantiles**. The OLS significance is entirely driven by the extensive margin (whether any policy exists).

### OLS Regression {#sec-eth-ols}

![Scatter plot of ethics scores against log GDP per capita.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_gdp_scatter.png){#fig-eth-gdp-scatter}

The OLS model for ethics produces a nominally significant GDP coefficient:

| Variable | $\beta$ | SE | $t$ | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|:---|
| log(GDP pc) | 0.061 | 0.020 | 3.05 | .002 |
| Good text quality | 1.014 | — | — | < .001 |

However, the quantile regression results below reveal that this significance is illusory.

### Quantile Regression: The Zero-Effect Finding {#sec-eth-quantile}

| Quantile ($\tau$) | GDP $\beta$ | SE | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| 0.25 (positive subset) | 0.000 | — | n.s. |
| 0.50 | 0.000 | — | n.s. |
| 0.75 | 0.000 | — | n.s. |
| OLS (reference) | 0.061 | 0.020 | .002 |

: Quantile regression: GDP effect across the ethics distribution {#tbl-eth-qr}

This is the chapter's central finding: **GDP has exactly zero effect on ethics scores at every quantile**. The OLS significance ($\beta = 0.061$, $p = .002$) is entirely an artefact of the *extensive margin* — richer countries produce more policies, and more policies means a higher chance of at least one scoring above zero. But *conditional on having a non-zero score*, GDP adds nothing.

This finding has profound implications: ethical governance is not a luxury good. Countries at any income level can — and do — produce policies with substantive ethics content.

### Multilevel Model {#sec-eth-multilevel}

![Country random effects from the multilevel ethics model.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/robustness/fig_country_random_effects.png){#fig-eth-re}

| Metric | OLS | Mixed |
|:---|---:|---:|
| GDP $\beta$ | 0.061 | 0.029 |
| GDP $p$ | .002 | .38 |
| Country ICC | — | **0.125** |

: Multilevel model comparison for ethics {#tbl-eth-multilevel}

The multilevel model reinforces the quantile regression finding: once country-level nesting is properly accounted for, the GDP coefficient drops to 0.029 and becomes **non-significant** ($p = .38$). The country ICC is 12.5% — modestly higher than for capacity (9.1%), suggesting that country-level factors explain more variation in ethics than in capacity.

### Tobit Regression {#sec-eth-tobit}

![Comparison of OLS and Tobit coefficients for the ethics model.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_tobit_comparison.png){#fig-eth-tobit}

| Variable | OLS $\beta$ | Tobit $\beta$ |
|:---|---:|---:|
| log(GDP pc) | 0.061 | 0.100 |
| Good text quality | — | 1.014 |
| $\sigma$ | — | 0.700 |
| P(uncensored at mean) | — | 0.725 |
| Floor: score = 0 | 36.3% | — |

: Tobit model for ethics {#tbl-eth-tobit}

The Tobit model corrects for the more severe floor effect in ethics (36.3% vs. 27.6% for capacity). The censoring-corrected GDP coefficient (0.100) is larger than OLS (0.061), but recall that the quantile regression shows this entire effect operates through the extensive margin — it reflects the higher probability of producing *any* ethics content, not higher scores conditional on content.

### Synthesis {#sec-eth-determinants-synthesis}

The ethics determinants analysis yields a clear headline: **GDP does not buy better ethics governance**. This contrasts sharply with capacity, where GDP has a modest but genuine effect (particularly on Resources). The distinction is theoretically coherent: implementation infrastructure (budgets, agencies, legal mandates) scales with fiscal capacity, while ethical commitment (rights language, stakeholder inclusion, accountability norms) does not.

This finding also undercuts a common narrative that developing countries should first build economic capacity before investing in AI ethics governance. The evidence says otherwise: ethical governance frameworks are achievable at any income level, and several developing countries — including Colombia, Kenya, and Brazil — demonstrate this in practice.
