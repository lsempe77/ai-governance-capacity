## Temporal Trends, Diffusion, and the Efficiency Frontier {#sec-cap-dynamics}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** This chapter examines how governance capacity evolves over time, how policies diffuse across jurisdictions, and which countries achieve the most governance capacity per unit of GDP — the efficiency frontier.

### Temporal Trends {#sec-cap-temporal}

![Capacity dimension scores over time (2017–2025). Most dimensions show modest upward trends.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/fig_temporal_dimensions.png){#fig-cap-temporal-dims}

![Capacity trends by income group over time. The gap between HI and developing countries remains stable.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/fig_temporal_income.png){#fig-cap-temporal-income}

The temporal trend in capacity scores shows **no significant convergence** between income groups:

| Metric | Capacity |
|:---|:---|
| Income × Year interaction | $\beta = +0.0003$, $p = .98$ |
| HI temporal slope | −0.0001/yr (n.s.) |
| Developing temporal slope | +0.010/yr (n.s.) |
| Gap trend | Stable |

Unlike ethics scores (see @sec-eth-dynamics), the capacity gap between income groups is **stable over time** — neither widening nor narrowing. High-income countries maintain a consistent advantage in implementation architecture.

### Policy Diffusion Patterns {#sec-cap-diffusion}

How do AI governance policies spread across countries? We model diffusion using adoption timing analysis.

![Regional diffusion heatmap showing the spread of AI governance policies across regions and years.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/frontier/fig_diffusion_heatmap.png){#fig-cap-diffusion-heatmap}

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| HI median first adoption | 2018 |
| Developing median first adoption | 2019 |
| Adoption lag (HI earlier by) | **1.3 years** ($p = .030$) |
| HI adoption by 2025 | 98% |
| Developing adoption by 2025 | 86% |
| Diffusion direction | **98% horizontal** |

: Policy diffusion patterns for capacity {#tbl-cap-diffusion}

The diffusion analysis reveals two key findings:

1. **HI countries are early adopters** by about 1.3 years — they reach critical mass by 2018, while developing countries reach it by 2019–2020.
2. **Diffusion is overwhelmingly horizontal** (98%): countries adopt policies from peers within their income group, not in a top-down cascade from rich to poor. This challenges the "Brussels Effect" [@bradford2020] hypothesis of vertical regulatory diffusion and supports a model of peer-to-peer policy learning.

The regions with the largest adoption lag are **SSA and MENA** (14–29% adoption by 2019 vs. 100% in NAM).

### Governance Efficiency Frontier {#sec-cap-frontier}

Which countries get the most governance capacity per dollar of GDP? We construct an efficiency frontier using Free Disposable Hull (FDH) analysis, plotting governance scores against GDP per capita.

![Efficiency frontier for capacity scores. Countries above the line outperform their GDP-predicted governance level; those below underperform.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/frontier/fig_efficiency_frontier.png){#fig-cap-frontier}

![Residual ranking: countries sorted by their distance from GDP-predicted capacity. Brazil, Kenya, and Rwanda are the top overperformers.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/frontier/fig_residual_ranking.png){#fig-cap-residual}

![Profile comparison of the most notable over- and under-performers.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/frontier/fig_overunder_profile.png){#fig-cap-overunder}

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| OLS $R^2$ (score ~ GDP) | **0.035** |
| Top overperformer | 🇧🇷 Brazil (+0.69) |
| Top underperformer | 🇰🇿 Kazakhstan (−0.75) |
| Frontier countries (FDH) | Uganda → Rwanda → Kenya → Brazil |
| Most efficient (score/$10k GDP) | Rwanda (3.10), Kenya (1.91) |
| Mean distance to frontier | 0.588 |

: Efficiency frontier results for capacity {#tbl-cap-frontier}

The efficiency frontier analysis delivers the chapter's headline finding: **GDP explains only 3.5% of country-level capacity variation** ($R^2 = 0.035$). The frontier is anchored by African countries — Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda — with modest GDP but focused governance efforts. Brazil, with its comprehensive AI governance framework, is the top overall overperformer.

On the other side, **Kazakhstan** ($-0.75$ residual) and **Korea** underperform most dramatically relative to their GDP levels — countries with substantial resources but governance scores well below what their wealth would predict.

### Chapter Summary {#sec-cap-dynamics-summary}

The dynamic analyses paint a consistent picture:

- **No convergence**: The capacity gap is stable over time.
- **Horizontal diffusion**: Countries learn from peers, not from wealthy exemplars.
- **GDP is not destiny**: National wealth explains a trivial share of governance capacity. What matters is *how* countries deploy their resources, not *how much* they have.

These findings have direct implications for development policy: capacity-building interventions should facilitate peer-to-peer learning within income groups rather than transplanting "best practice" models from high-income countries.
