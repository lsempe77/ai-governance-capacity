## Temporal Trends, Diffusion, and the Efficiency Frontier {#sec-cap-dynamics}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** This chapter examines how governance capacity evolves over time, how policies diffuse across jurisdictions, and which countries achieve the most governance capacity per unit of GDP — the efficiency frontier.

### Temporal Trends {#sec-cap-temporal}

The cross-sectional analyses in preceding chapters established that income-group gaps in capacity prove modest and dominated by within-group variation. But these static comparisons cannot reveal whether gaps are widening, narrowing, or remaining stable over time — a question central to understanding AI governance evolution. If developing countries are converging toward high-income capacity levels, this would suggest that policy diffusion, technical assistance, and learning mechanisms are successfully closing implementation readiness gaps. If gaps are widening, this would indicate that wealthy countries are pulling further ahead as governance sophistication increases. If gaps remain stable, this would suggest that the factors determining capacity — whatever they are — persist across time without structural change.

Convergence analysis tests these scenarios by examining whether the income-group × year interaction term is statistically significant and in which direction it points. A negative interaction would indicate convergence (developing countries improving faster than high-income countries), a positive interaction would indicate divergence (gaps widening), and a near-zero interaction would suggest stability.

@fig-cap-temporal-dims reveals that individual capacity dimensions exhibit modest upward trends from 2017 to 2025, with most dimensions improving slightly but no dramatic leaps in implementation readiness. @fig-cap-temporal-income shows that these parallel trends maintain consistent gaps between income groups rather than converging or diverging. The formal statistical tests quantify this stability:

| Metric | Capacity |
|:---|:---|
| Income × Year interaction | $\beta = +0.0003$, $p = .98$ |
| HI temporal slope | −0.0001/yr (n.s.) |
| Developing temporal slope | +0.010/yr (n.s.) |
| Gap trend | Stable |

: Convergence test for capacity scores {#tbl-cap-convergence}

@tbl-cap-convergence reveals **no significant convergence** between income groups on capacity dimensions. The income × year interaction coefficient (β = +0.0003, p = .98) proves statistically indistinguishable from zero and substantively negligible, indicating that neither convergence nor divergence characterizes the 2017-2025 period. High-income countries show essentially flat temporal trends (−0.0001 points per year, non-significant), while developing countries exhibit modest improvement (+0.010 points per year, non-significant), but this difference proves insufficient to narrow gaps meaningfully.

The stable gap contrasts sharply with ethics scores examined in @sec-eth-dynamics, where we observe significant convergence driven by high-income countries declining while developing countries remain flat. Capacity dimensions apparently resist the convergence pressures affecting ethics governance, suggesting different diffusion mechanisms. One interpretation holds that capacity dimensions — requiring fiscal resources, technical expertise, and administrative infrastructure — prove more difficult to improve through policy learning alone. Countries can adopt ethical principles by referencing international frameworks, but building implementation capacity requires institutional development that wealth continues to facilitate.

Alternatively, the stable gap may reflect measurement artifacts: if text quality correlates with year (newer policies more fully documented), apparent stability could mask true changes. The robustness checks in @sec-robustness examine this possibility by restricting temporal analyses to consistently well-documented policies across years. The stability finding, if robust to these checks, suggests that the implementation readiness gap is structural rather than transient — it will not close automatically through diffusion and learning without targeted interventions addressing specific capacity constraints.

### Policy Diffusion Patterns {#sec-cap-diffusion}

The stable capacity gap raises a fundamental question about governance evolution: how do AI governance policies spread across countries, and does diffusion follow patterns that might eventually narrow implementation readiness differences? Two diffusion models dominate the comparative policy literature. The **vertical diffusion** model, exemplified by Bradford's [-@bradford2020] "Brussels Effect," posits that regulatory innovations flow from wealthy, sophisticated jurisdictions to developing countries through mechanisms like conditional aid, technical assistance, and the desire to signal modernity through policy adoption. This top-down cascade would manifest as high-income countries adopting policies first, followed by developing countries emulating these models after a lag period.

Alternatively, the **horizontal diffusion** model emphasizes peer-to-peer learning within income groups, where countries look to jurisdictions facing similar institutional constraints and resource levels for policy models. Developing countries might learn primarily from other developing countries with comparable governance challenges, while wealthy countries benchmark against other wealthy nations. This within-group learning would manifest as parallel policy adoption curves across income groups with minimal cross-group diffusion.

Distinguishing these models matters because they imply radically different capacity-building strategies. Vertical diffusion suggests that strengthening high-income governance frameworks will eventually benefit developing countries through demonstration effects and policy transfer. Horizontal diffusion suggests that South-South cooperation and peer learning networks within income groups prove more consequential than North-South knowledge transfer.

We model diffusion using adoption timing analysis, tracking when each country first adopted AI governance policies and examining whether adoption patterns reflect vertical or horizontal diffusion.

![Regional diffusion heatmap showing the spread of AI governance policies across regions and years.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/frontier/fig_diffusion_heatmap.png){#fig-cap-diffusion-heatmap}

@fig-cap-diffusion, @fig-cap-first-movers, and @fig-cap-diffusion-heatmap together visualize diffusion dynamics across time, income groups, and regions. The adoption curves show that high-income countries reached critical mass slightly earlier, but both groups exhibit steep adoption increases in 2018-2020, suggesting parallel rather than sequential adoption. The formal statistics quantify these patterns:

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| HI median first adoption | 2018 |
| Developing median first adoption | 2019 |
| Adoption lag (HI earlier by) | **1.3 years** ($p = .030$) |
| HI adoption by 2025 | 98% |
| Developing adoption by 2025 | 86% |
| Diffusion direction | **98% horizontal** |

: Policy diffusion patterns for capacity {#tbl-cap-diffusion}

@tbl-cap-diffusion reveals two critical findings about how AI governance policies spread globally. First, **high-income countries function as early adopters** by approximately 1.3 years (p = .030), reaching their median first adoption in 2018 compared to 2019 for developing countries. This temporal lag proves statistically significant but substantively modest — roughly 15 months separating first-mover high-income countries from first-mover developing countries. By 2025, adoption rates have largely converged, with 98% of high-income countries and 86% of developing countries having adopted at least one AI governance policy. The gap thus reflects timing rather than ultimate adoption likelihood.

Second and more consequentially, **diffusion is overwhelmingly horizontal** rather than vertical, with 98% of policy adoption occurring through within-group learning. We classify diffusion as "horizontal" when countries cite, reference, or temporally follow policies from within their income group, and "vertical" when developing countries explicitly adopt or adapt frameworks from high-income countries (such as directly implementing EU AI Act provisions). The 98% horizontal figure indicates that countries look primarily to peers facing similar institutional contexts for governance models.

This finding fundamentally challenges the Brussels Effect hypothesis as applied to AI governance. While Bradford's theory holds that EU regulations diffuse globally through market mechanisms — with multinational firms finding it efficient to adopt stringent EU standards worldwide — we observe minimal evidence of such top-down regulatory cascades in our adoption data. Developing countries are not systematically copying GDPR-inspired data protection frameworks or EU AI Act risk-based approaches in their early AI governance efforts. Instead, they develop policies reflecting their own institutional priorities, regulatory traditions, and stakeholder consultations.

The horizontal pattern admits several explanations. Developing countries may recognize that wealthy-country governance models assume institutional infrastructure they lack — sophisticated data protection authorities, judicial capacity to enforce algorithmic accountability, technical expertise to audit AI systems — making direct transplantation infeasible. They instead look to peer countries that have successfully adapted governance frameworks to resource constraints. Alternatively, countries may resist perceived "regulatory imperialism" from wealthy nations, preferring to develop indigenous approaches that maintain policy autonomy. Or developing countries may simply lack the technical assistance infrastructure that would facilitate vertical knowledge transfer, while regional organizations and South-South cooperation networks enable horizontal learning.

The regions exhibiting the largest adoption lag — **Sub-Saharan Africa and MENA** (14-29% adoption by 2019 versus 100% in North America) — suggest that geographic and institutional distance from early-mover regions creates diffusion barriers. SSA and MENA lack the dense policy networks connecting European countries or the regional coordination mechanisms linking Latin American nations, potentially explaining slower adoption. Yet even these late-adopting regions show primarily horizontal diffusion when they do adopt, learning from regional peers rather than importing wealthy-country frameworks wholesale.

### Governance Efficiency Frontier {#sec-cap-frontier}

The preceding analyses established that GDP explains little capacity variation and that diffusion occurs primarily horizontally within income groups. But these findings describe average patterns without identifying which specific countries outperform or underperform relative to their wealth levels. Efficiency frontier analysis addresses this gap by plotting governance scores against GDP per capita and identifying countries that achieve more capacity per dollar than their peers — those operating on the efficiency frontier — versus those falling below their GDP-predicted performance.

The efficiency concept comes from production economics, where firms operating on the frontier extract maximum output from given inputs while inefficient firms waste resources. Applied to governance, frontier countries demonstrate that high capacity can be achieved despite resource constraints, while countries below the frontier fail to convert wealth into governance quality. Identifying frontier countries provides concrete exemplars for others at similar wealth levels, while understanding underperformance reveals where institutional or political factors block capacity development despite available resources.

We employ Free Disposable Hull (FDH) analysis, a non-parametric frontier estimation technique that constructs the efficiency boundary by connecting countries that dominate all others at similar or lower GDP levels. Countries on the frontier are those where no other country achieves higher governance scores with equal or less wealth.

![Efficiency frontier for capacity scores. Countries above the line outperform their GDP-predicted governance level; those below underperform.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/frontier/fig_efficiency_frontier.png){#fig-cap-frontier}

![Residual ranking: countries sorted by their distance from GDP-predicted capacity. Brazil, Kenya, and Rwanda are the top overperformers.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/frontier/fig_residual_ranking.png){#fig-cap-residual}

![Profile comparison of the most notable over- and under-performers.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/frontier/fig_overunder_profile.png){#fig-cap-overunder}

@fig-cap-frontier plots governance capacity against log GDP per capita with the regression line indicating GDP-predicted performance. Countries above the line outperform predictions; those below underperform. @fig-cap-residual ranks countries by their residual distance from this line, highlighting the most dramatic over- and under-performers. @fig-cap-overunder provides dimensional profiles showing where efficiency gains (or losses) concentrate. The summary statistics reveal the frontier's structure:

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| OLS $R^2$ (score ~ GDP) | **0.035** |
| Top overperformer | 🇧🇷 Brazil (+0.69) |
| Top underperformer | 🇰🇿 Kazakhstan (−0.75) |
| Frontier countries (FDH) | Uganda → Rwanda → Kenya → Brazil |
| Most efficient (score/$10k GDP) | Rwanda (3.10), Kenya (1.91) |
| Mean distance to frontier | 0.588 |

: Efficiency frontier results for capacity {#tbl-cap-frontier}

@tbl-cap-frontier delivers this chapter's headline empirical finding: **GDP explains only 3.5% of country-level capacity variation** (R² = 0.035). This trivial explanatory power confirms the regression analyses in @sec-cap-determinants at the country-aggregated level. Knowing a country's GDP provides almost no information about its governance capacity scores. The scatterplot in @fig-cap-frontier visually confirms this weak relationship — the cloud of points disperses widely around the regression line, with many developing countries scoring above wealthy ones and vice versa.

The efficiency frontier itself is anchored by African countries demonstrating that governance sophistication does not require first-world wealth. **Rwanda** emerges as the most efficient country per capita, achieving 3.10 capacity points per $10,000 of GDP — nearly double Kenya's 1.91 and far exceeding any high-income country's efficiency ratio. Rwanda's comprehensive AI governance framework, including data protection legislation and national AI strategy with implementation roadmaps, demonstrates sophisticated policy design despite per-capita GDP below $1,000. **Kenya** and **Uganda** similarly feature on the frontier, having adopted binding AI legislation with enforcement mechanisms and coordination frameworks that rival or exceed policies from countries 10-20 times wealthier.

**Brazil** stands out as the top overall overperformer with a +0.69 residual — the largest positive distance from GDP-predicted performance. Brazil's achievement reflects sustained policy commitment across multiple dimensions: comprehensive national AI strategy, detailed regulatory frameworks for algorithmic accountability, cross-ministry coordination mechanisms, and extensive stakeholder consultation processes. This governance infrastructure emerges from political choices to prioritize AI governance rather than from fiscal abundance. Brazil's success suggests that mid-income countries can achieve implementation readiness comparable to wealthy nations through focused policy design and institutional coordination.

On the underperformance side, **Kazakhstan** exhibits the most dramatic negative residual (−0.75), scoring well below its GDP-predicted level despite substantial national wealth from natural resources. Other notable underperformers include **South Korea**, whose sophisticated technology sector and high GDP would predict comprehensive AI governance but whose actual policy portfolio remains limited in operational detail. These cases suggest that wealth proves necessary but insufficient — governance capacity requires political will, institutional coordination, and policy prioritization that resources alone cannot guarantee.

The mean distance to frontier (0.588) indicates that the average country operates substantially below the efficiency boundary, suggesting widespread room for governance improvement without requiring additional resources. Countries could strengthen implementation readiness by learning from frontier exemplars at similar income levels rather than assuming that capacity building requires first-world budgets.

### Chapter Summary {#sec-cap-dynamics-summary}

The temporal, diffusion, and efficiency analyses converge on three interconnected findings that fundamentally reshape how we understand AI governance capacity development. The **temporal stability** of capacity gaps — neither widening nor narrowing over the 2017-2025 period — indicates that current diffusion mechanisms are insufficient to close implementation readiness differences. Unlike ethics scores, which show convergence through principle adoption, capacity dimensions resist automatic improvement through policy learning alone. Building implementation infrastructure apparently requires targeted interventions addressing specific institutional constraints rather than relying on demonstration effects from early-adopting wealthy countries.

The **horizontal diffusion pattern** challenges assumptions that wealthy-country frameworks will naturally cascade to developing nations. With 98% of policy adoption occurring through within-group learning, AI governance apparently spreads through peer networks rather than top-down transfer. Countries look to jurisdictions facing similar institutional contexts for governance models, recognizing that wealthy-country frameworks often assume infrastructure they lack. This finding carries direct implications for technical assistance: rather than promoting "best practice" models from high-income countries, capacity-building should facilitate South-South cooperation enabling developing countries to learn from peers who have successfully adapted governance frameworks to resource constraints.

The **efficiency frontier analysis** demonstrates that **GDP is not destiny** — national wealth explains only 3.5% of governance capacity variation at the country level. Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, and Brazil achieve implementation readiness far exceeding their GDP-predicted levels through strategic policy choices, institutional coordination, and political commitment. These frontier countries prove that governance sophistication emerges from *how* resources are deployed rather than *how much* wealth is available. Conversely, Kazakhstan and South Korea demonstrate that substantial wealth provides no guarantee of governance capacity absent institutional prioritization.

Together, these findings point toward an actionable framework for global capacity building: rather than assuming that developing countries must await economic development before building governance capacity, or that wealthy-country models should be transplanted wholesale, effective interventions should identify and support peer-to-peer learning networks within income groups while studying what enables frontier countries to outperform their resource constraints. Rwanda's efficiency ratio of 3.10 per $10K GDP versus typical high-income efficiency ratios below 0.50 suggests that strategic governance choices matter far more than national budgets for implementation readiness.
