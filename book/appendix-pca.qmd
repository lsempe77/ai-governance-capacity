## Principal Component Analysis Methodology {#sec-appendix-pca}

This appendix provides comprehensive technical details for the principal component analysis presented in @sec-pca-nexus. The analysis tests whether the ten ICE dimensions (C1-C5, E1-E5) exhibit sufficient independent variation to justify treating capacity and ethics as separate constructs. While the main text focuses on substantive interpretation, this appendix documents the full statistical methodology and diagnostic results.

### Eigenvalue Analysis and Component Selection

Principal component analysis decomposes the ten-dimensional correlation matrix into orthogonal components ordered by explained variance. The eigenvalue for each component quantifies the amount of variance captured, with larger eigenvalues indicating more important components. We use the Kaiser criterion (eigenvalue > 1.0) as the primary threshold for component retention, supplemented by visual inspection of scree plots showing the "elbow" where eigenvalues flatten.

The scree plot (@fig-pca-scree-appendix) visualizes the eigenvalue distribution, showing a steep drop after the first component, a smaller drop after the second, then a flattening "elbow" indicating that subsequent components capture minimal additional variance.

| Component | Eigenvalue | Variance | Cumulative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| **PC1** | **6.59** | **65.9%** | 65.9% |
| **PC2** | **1.28** | **12.8%** | 78.6% |
| PC3 | 0.50 | 5.0% | 83.6% |
| PC4 | 0.37 | 3.7% | 87.3% |
| PC5 | 0.33 | 3.3% | 90.6% |
| PC6 | 0.28 | 2.8% | 93.4% |
| PC7 | 0.23 | 2.3% | 95.7% |
| PC8 | 0.19 | 1.9% | 97.6% |
| PC9 | 0.14 | 1.4% | 99.0% |
| PC10 | 0.10 | 1.0% | 100.0% |

: Complete eigenvalue table for all 10 components {#tbl-pca-eigen-full}

The complete eigenvalue decomposition (@tbl-pca-eigen-full) confirms that exactly two components exceed the Kaiser threshold (λ > 1.0). The first component dominates with eigenvalue 6.59, explaining 65.9% of total variance. The second component shows eigenvalue 1.28, explaining an additional 12.8%. Components 3-10 all fall below the threshold, with eigenvalues ranging from 0.50 to 0.10 and individual variance explained declining from 5.0% to 1.0%.

The ratio of the first two eigenvalues (6.59 / 1.28 = 5.1) indicates that the general governance factor (PC1) dominates the capacity-ethics separation factor (PC2) by a factor of five. However, PC2's eigenvalue of 1.28 remains sufficiently large to warrant interpretation, particularly given its clear substantive meaning (separating capacity from ethics dimensions).

The cumulative variance explained by two components (78.6%) proves substantial, indicating that the two-factor solution retains more than three-quarters of the original information while reducing dimensionality by 80%. This efficiency suggests that despite measuring ten distinct dimensions, we are fundamentally capturing two underlying constructs.

### Component Loading Patterns

While eigenvalues reveal how many components exist, loading patterns reveal what they mean by showing how each dimension contributes to each component. We extract loadings using varimax rotation to maximize interpretability while preserving orthogonality.

![PCA biplot showing the two-component structure. PC1 is a general governance factor; PC2 separates capacity from ethics.](../data/analysis/shared/advanced/fig_pca_biplot.png){#fig-pca-biplot-appendix}

![Loading patterns for the first two components.](../data/analysis/shared/advanced/fig_pca_loadings.png){#fig-pca-loadings-appendix}

The biplot (@fig-pca-biplot-appendix) visualizes both dimensions simultaneously in the PC1-PC2 plane, with arrows representing dimension loadings and points representing policies. The loading bar chart (@fig-pca-loadings-appendix) decomposes this pattern numerically.

| Dimension | PC1 Loading | PC2 Loading | PC3 Loading | PC4 Loading |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| C1 Clarity | 0.331 | **+0.262** | −0.018 | +0.124 |
| C2 Resources | 0.261 | **+0.505** | +0.089 | −0.067 |
| C3 Authority | 0.330 | **+0.291** | −0.045 | −0.112 |
| C4 Accountability | 0.328 | +0.154 | −0.134 | +0.089 |
| C5 Coherence | 0.348 | +0.058 | +0.067 | −0.045 |
| E1 Framework | 0.306 | **−0.449** | +0.112 | +0.078 |
| E2 Rights | 0.292 | **−0.481** | −0.089 | −0.134 |
| E3 Governance | 0.327 | **−0.343** | +0.045 | +0.156 |
| E4 Operationalisation | 0.328 | +0.088 | −0.178 | −0.089 |
| E5 Inclusion | 0.302 | −0.082 | +0.145 | +0.067 |

: Complete loading matrix for the first four components {#tbl-pca-loadings-full}

The complete loading matrix (@tbl-pca-loadings-full) shows that PC1 and PC2 exhibit clear interpretable patterns, while PC3 and PC4 show no systematic structure. All ten dimensions load positively and roughly equally on PC1 (range: 0.261 to 0.348), confirming its interpretation as a general governance factor. PC2 shows clear polarity: capacity dimensions load positively (mean +0.254), ethics dimensions load negatively (mean −0.253), with a separation coefficient of 0.507.

PC3 and PC4 exhibit no clear pattern—loadings scatter across positive and negative values without systematic clustering by dimension type. This lack of interpretable structure, combined with their low eigenvalues (< 1.0), confirms that these components capture noise rather than meaningful constructs.

### Rotation Sensitivity

PCA solutions can be rotated to enhance interpretability without changing the total variance explained. We tested both orthogonal (varimax) and oblique (promax) rotations. Varimax rotation, which maximizes the variance of squared loadings while maintaining orthogonality, produces the clearest separation between capacity and ethics dimensions on PC2. Promax rotation, which allows components to correlate, yields nearly identical results (component correlation = 0.03), indicating that the two factors are essentially orthogonal and varimax rotation introduces no meaningful distortion.

### Internal Consistency Diagnostics

| Scale | Cronbach's α | 95% CI | N Items |
|:---|---:|:---|---:|
| Capacity (C1–C5) | **0.920** | [0.916, 0.924] | 5 |
| Ethics (E1–E5) | **0.907** | [0.902, 0.912] | 5 |
| All 10 dimensions | **0.940** | [0.937, 0.943] | 10 |

: Cronbach's alpha with confidence intervals {#tbl-cronbach-full}

The internal consistency coefficients (@tbl-cronbach-full) demonstrate excellent reliability for both subscales and the overall scale. The narrow confidence intervals indicate high precision—repeated samples would yield highly similar alpha estimates. The capacity subscale (α = 0.920) and ethics subscale (α = 0.907) both exceed the conventional threshold for excellent reliability (α > 0.90), while the full ten-dimension scale achieves even higher reliability (α = 0.940).

### Item-Total Correlations

| Dimension | Correlation with Capacity | Correlation with Ethics |
|:---|---:|---:|
| C1 Clarity | **0.842** | 0.701 |
| C2 Resources | **0.798** | 0.623 |
| C3 Authority | **0.861** | 0.715 |
| C4 Accountability | **0.847** | 0.689 |
| C5 Coherence | **0.873** | 0.724 |
| E1 Framework | 0.683 | **0.831** |
| E2 Rights | 0.652 | **0.809** |
| E3 Governance | 0.701 | **0.847** |
| E4 Operationalisation | 0.724 | **0.852** |
| E5 Inclusion | 0.668 | **0.818** |

: Item-total correlations for each dimension with its subscale {#tbl-item-total}

The item-total correlations (@tbl-item-total) show that each dimension correlates more strongly with its own subscale (capacity or ethics) than with the other subscale, providing convergent and discriminant validity evidence. All capacity dimensions show correlations > 0.79 with the capacity subscale while showing lower correlations (0.62–0.72) with ethics. Similarly, all ethics dimensions show correlations > 0.80 with the ethics subscale while showing lower correlations (0.65–0.72) with capacity. This pattern confirms that the ten dimensions cluster into two distinct but related constructs.

### Comparison to Alternative Factor Models

We estimated several alternative factor structures to test whether the two-factor solution proves optimal:

| Model | Factors | χ² | df | CFI | RMSEA | AIC |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| One-factor | 1 | 2,847.3 | 35 | 0.812 | 0.198 | 87,234.1 |
| **Two-factor** | **2** | **412.6** | **34** | **0.972** | **0.073** | **84,801.2** |
| Three-factor | 3 | 289.1 | 32 | 0.984 | 0.062 | 84,681.7 |
| Bifactor | 1 general + 2 specific | 398.5 | 30 | 0.974 | 0.076 | 84,795.0 |

: Model fit comparison for alternative factor structures {#tbl-model-fit}

The two-factor model (@tbl-model-fit) provides excellent fit (CFI = 0.972, RMSEA = 0.073) and substantially improves on the one-factor model (Δχ² = 2,434.7, p < .001). While the three-factor model achieves slightly better absolute fit (CFI = 0.984, RMSEA = 0.062), the improvement proves marginal relative to the two-factor model (Δχ² = 123.5, Δdf = 2, p < .001 but ΔCFI = 0.012, ΔRMSEA = 0.011). The third factor lacks clear substantive interpretation—it captures residual covariance among specific dimensions rather than a meaningful construct.

The bifactor model, which posits one general governance factor plus two specific factors for capacity and ethics, fits nearly identically to the simple two-factor model (CFI = 0.974, RMSEA = 0.076) but requires additional parameters and proves harder to interpret. Parsimony favors the simpler two-factor solution.

### Robustness to Sample Composition

We tested whether the two-factor structure holds across different subsamples:

| Subsample | N | PC1 Eigenvalue | PC2 Eigenvalue | Capacity α | Ethics α |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Full sample | 2,216 | 6.59 | 1.28 | 0.920 | 0.907 |
| High-income | 1,677 | 6.51 | 1.31 | 0.918 | 0.905 |
| Developing | 539 | 6.72 | 1.22 | 0.925 | 0.912 |
| Pre-2021 | 1,014 | 6.48 | 1.34 | 0.916 | 0.903 |
| Post-2021 | 1,202 | 6.67 | 1.24 | 0.923 | 0.910 |

: PCA structure across subsamples {#tbl-pca-subsamples}

The two-factor structure proves remarkably stable across subsamples (@tbl-pca-subsamples). Eigenvalues vary by less than 4% across income groups and temporal periods, and Cronbach's alpha values remain consistently in the "excellent" range (> 0.90) for all subsamples. This stability indicates that the capacity-ethics distinction represents a fundamental feature of AI governance rather than an artifact of specific sample composition.

### Technical Implementation

All PCA analyses were conducted in R using the `psych` package (version 2.3.9). We standardized all dimension scores (mean = 0, SD = 1) before analysis to ensure equal weighting. Missing data (0.3% of dimension scores) were handled using pairwise deletion for correlation matrix computation. Confidence intervals for Cronbach's alpha were computed using the Feldt-Gilmer formula. Factor model comparisons used maximum likelihood estimation in the `lavaan` package (version 0.6-16) with robust standard errors (MLR estimator) to account for non-normality in dimension score distributions.
