## Within vs. Between: Decomposing the Governance Gap {#sec-cap-inequality}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** This chapter moves beyond mean comparisons to examine the *structure* of governance inequality. Using Gini coefficients, Theil decomposition, policy portfolio analysis, and K-means clustering, we show that within-group inequality overwhelmingly dominates the between-group income gap.

### Inequality Decomposition {#sec-cap-gini}

The preceding determinants analysis revealed that national wealth explains remarkably little variance in governance capacity — only 3-12% depending on specification. But this finding alone does not tell us *how* inequality is structured. Two scenarios could produce weak GDP effects while appearing superficially similar in regression results. First, the income-group gap might be modest but stable, with most inequality occurring within countries as individual policies vary around consistent national means. Second, the gap might be substantial but obscured by enormous within-group heterogeneity, with some developing countries outperforming wealthy ones while others lag far behind. Distinguishing these scenarios requires explicit inequality decomposition that partitions total variance into between-group and within-group components.

Inequality metrics from the economic literature provide precisely this decomposition. Gini coefficients quantify overall concentration in capacity scores, while Theil indices enable exact additive decomposition into group-specific contributions. These tools reveal not just whether inequality exists but *where* it concentrates — between income groups or within them.

![Lorenz curves for capacity scores, by income group and overall. Both groups exhibit substantial inequality, with developing countries showing slightly more concentration.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/extended/fig_lorenz.png){#fig-cap-lorenz}

@fig-cap-lorenz presents Lorenz curves visualizing inequality within and between income groups. If capacity were equally distributed, policies would fall along the 45-degree line where each percentile of policies accounts for its proportional share of total capacity. The observed curves bow below this line, indicating concentration: top-scoring policies capture disproportionate shares of total capacity. The Gini coefficient quantifies this departure from perfect equality:

| Metric | Value |
|:---|---:|
| Gini (all countries) | 0.518 |
| Gini (HI only) | 0.499 |
| Gini (Developing) | 0.593 |
| Gini (country means) | 0.235 |

: Gini coefficients for capacity scores {#tbl-cap-gini}

@tbl-cap-gini reveals that the Gini coefficient for capacity scores across all countries reaches **0.518** — substantial inequality comparable to income inequality in moderately unequal countries. This level of concentration indicates that governance capacity is far from evenly distributed globally. However, the group-specific Gini coefficients expose a striking pattern: **developing countries exhibit higher within-group inequality (Gini = 0.593) than high-income countries (0.499)**. The variation among developing countries — from Brazil and Colombia at the high end to countries with minimal AI governance at the low end — exceeds the variation among wealthy countries, where institutional capacity proves more uniformly distributed.

This finding contradicts the simple North-South divide narrative. If developing countries were uniformly weak on governance capacity, their within-group Gini would be low, with all countries clustering around similarly modest scores. Instead, the high developing-country Gini (0.593) indicates enormous heterogeneity: some developing countries achieve governance capacity rivaling or exceeding wealthy nations, while others produce minimal governance output. The developing-country category thus obscures more than it reveals, conflating high-performers like Brazil and Kenya with countries barely represented in global AI governance.

The Gini for country means (0.235) — calculated by first averaging scores within countries, then computing inequality across those country-level means — proves less than half the overall Gini (0.518). This compression indicates that country-level aggregation eliminates much inequality, confirming that most variation occurs at the policy level within countries rather than between countries. These patterns foreshadow the Theil decomposition below, which provides exact quantification of this within-versus-between partition.

#### Theil Decomposition

The Gini coefficients suggested that within-group inequality dominates, but they cannot provide exact quantification of how much inequality resides within versus between income groups. Theil's T index addresses this limitation through its key mathematical property: exact additive decomposition. Unlike most inequality measures, Theil indices can be perfectly partitioned into between-group and within-group components that sum to total inequality, enabling precise statements about where inequality concentrates.

![Theil decomposition of capacity inequality: 98.8% within groups, only 1.2% between income groups.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/extended/fig_theil_decomposition.png){#fig-cap-theil}

@fig-cap-theil visualizes the decomposition result, which delivers this chapter's central empirical finding. The formal results prove even more striking than the Gini coefficients suggested:

| Component | Share |
|:---|---:|
| **Between** income groups | **1.2%** |
| **Within** income groups | **98.8%** |

: Theil decomposition of capacity inequality {#tbl-cap-theil}

@tbl-cap-theil quantifies what @fig-cap-theil visualizes: **the income-group label explains only 1.2% of total capacity inequality**, while **98.8% of inequality resides within income groups**. This decomposition fundamentally undermines narratives that attribute governance gaps primarily to the North-South divide. If income-group membership primarily determined capacity, between-group inequality would dominate the decomposition — perhaps 40-60% of total inequality, as observed in global income distributions. Instead, we find that knowing whether a country is classified as "high-income" or "developing" provides almost no information about its governance capacity scores.

The 98.8% within-group share means that the variation within high-income countries — from Luxembourg's sophisticated framework to smaller European countries with minimal AI governance — dwarfs the average gap between high-income and developing countries. Similarly, the variation within developing countries — from Brazil's comprehensive legislation to countries with single-page announcements — vastly exceeds any systematic income-based difference. Afghanistan and Brazil are both classified as "developing," yet their governance capacity differs more than the average difference between high-income and developing groups.

This decomposition connects directly to the multilevel model findings in @sec-cap-determinants, where we found that 91% of variance occurred within countries rather than between them. Here we find an even more extreme concentration: 98.8% within income groups rather than between them. Together, these analyses converge on a consistent message: governance capacity is overwhelmingly determined by policy-specific and country-specific factors orthogonal to wealth. National income provides minimal predictive power, and income-group classifications prove nearly useless for forecasting governance quality.

The policy implications prove profound. Development interventions targeting "developing countries" as a homogeneous category will inevitably misallocate resources, assisting countries like Brazil and Colombia that have already achieved strong capacity while potentially neglecting wealthy countries with weak governance frameworks. Effective capacity-building requires identifying specific institutional constraints and design challenges rather than assuming that low-income status automatically indicates governance deficits.

### Policy Portfolio Breadth {#sec-cap-portfolio}

The inequality decomposition revealed that capacity differences occur primarily within income groups rather than between them, but this finding leaves an important question unanswered: what kind of differences drive this within-group variation? Two distinct mechanisms could produce low capacity scores. First, countries might systematically *miss* certain governance dimensions entirely, producing policies that address some implementation features while ignoring others. This would manifest as breadth gaps, where developing countries cover fewer dimensions than high-income countries. Second, countries might *cover* all dimensions but at varying depths, with some nations achieving comprehensive implementation architecture across all features while others provide only minimal specification. This would manifest as depth gaps, where dimensional coverage is similar but score levels differ.

Distinguishing breadth from depth matters for policy design. If developing countries miss dimensions, interventions should focus on ensuring comprehensive governance frameworks that address all implementation requirements. If instead countries cover dimensions but at insufficient depth, interventions should strengthen specification within already-identified areas. The portfolio analysis examines which mechanism predominates.

![Heatmap of policy portfolio coverage by country and dimension. Most countries cover all five dimensions in at least one policy.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/extended/fig_portfolio_heatmap.png){#fig-cap-portfolio-heatmap}

@fig-cap-portfolio-heatmap maps policy portfolio coverage across countries and dimensions, revealing that most jurisdictions — regardless of income — address all five capacity dimensions in at least some policy. The heatmap shows dense coverage rather than systematic gaps, suggesting that breadth deficits prove less consequential than depth variations.

![Portfolio breadth gap between income groups, by dimension. C4 Accountability shows the largest coverage gap.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/extended/fig_portfolio_gaps.png){#fig-cap-portfolio-gaps}

@fig-cap-portfolio-gaps quantifies dimensional coverage differences between income groups, revealing that gaps concentrate in specific dimensions rather than reflecting uniform undercoverage:

| Metric | HI | Developing | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| Mean breadth (out of 5) | 4.95 | 4.52 | .137 |
| Countries with 5/5 coverage | 93% | — | — |
| Least covered dimension | C4 (92.6%) | C4 (92.6%) | — |

: Policy portfolio breadth by income group {#tbl-cap-portfolio}

@tbl-cap-portfolio reveals a striking non-finding: the breadth gap between income groups **is not statistically significant** (p = .137), with high-income countries averaging 4.95 dimensions covered out of 5 and developing countries averaging 4.52. This difference, while visible, fails to reach conventional significance thresholds and proves substantively modest — developing countries cover 90% of dimensions on average, not dramatically less than the 99% coverage of high-income countries. The fact that 93% of high-income countries achieve 5/5 dimensional coverage confirms near-universal breadth among wealthy nations, but developing countries follow only slightly behind.

Crucially, **C4 Accountability emerges as the most commonly missing dimension across both groups** (92.6% coverage rate). This universal weakness suggests that accountability deficits transcend income categories — both wealthy and developing countries struggle to establish transparent monitoring and evaluation frameworks, perhaps because such mechanisms create political risks by enabling external assessment of implementation failures. The accountability gap thus reflects governance choices rather than resource constraints, explaining why income does not predict its presence.

The portfolio analysis therefore confirms that **the capacity gap is primarily about depth, not breadth**. Most countries, regardless of wealth, recognize that comprehensive AI governance requires addressing clarity, resources, authority, accountability, and coherence — they produce policies touching on all five dimensions. The income gap emerges instead from *how much implementation detail* policies provide within covered dimensions: whether resource specifications include concrete budget allocations, whether authority provisions establish enforcement mechanisms, whether accountability frameworks mandate regular reporting. Developing countries are not missing pieces of the governance puzzle; they are working with the same pieces but assembling them less completely.

### K-Means Clustering {#sec-cap-clusters}

The inequality and portfolio analyses established that capacity variation is overwhelmingly within-group rather than between-group, and that depth rather than breadth drives observed differences. But these findings describe the structure of variation without revealing whether distinct governance *typologies* exist — whether policies naturally group into categories with characteristic dimensional profiles. Cluster analysis addresses this question by identifying policies with similar multidimensional signatures, potentially revealing that governance approaches fall into recognizable archetypes regardless of income classification.

We employ K-means clustering to partition policies into k groups that maximize within-cluster homogeneity while maximizing between-cluster differences across all five capacity dimensions simultaneously. The optimal number of clusters k is determined through silhouette analysis, which measures how similar each policy is to its assigned cluster compared to the nearest alternative cluster. Higher silhouette scores indicate cleaner separation, suggesting natural groupings rather than arbitrary divisions.

![Radar chart of capacity dimension profiles for the two identified clusters. Cluster 1 ("Low Capacity") shows uniformly low scores; Cluster 2 ("Moderate Capacity") shows elevation across all dimensions.](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/fig_cluster_radar.png){#fig-cap-cluster-radar}

@fig-cap-cluster-radar displays the dimensional profiles of the two clusters identified through K-means analysis (k = 2, optimal by silhouette score = 0.41). The radar chart reveals that the clusters differ primarily in overall score levels rather than dimensional shape: both clusters exhibit similar relative strengths and weaknesses across dimensions, but at different absolute levels.

**Cluster 1 ("Low Capacity")** encompasses approximately 60% of policies, characterized by uniformly low scores across all five dimensions — typically scoring 0-1 on the 0-4 scale. These policies consist primarily of brief announcements, aspirational statements, or preliminary frameworks that mention governance concerns without specifying implementation mechanisms. The cluster includes both developing and high-income country policies, confirming that low-capacity governance documents emerge across income levels when countries issue statements without operational detail.

**Cluster 2 ("Moderate Capacity")** contains the remaining 40% of policies, showing elevated scores across dimensions with particular strength on C1 Clarity, C3 Authority, and C5 Coherence. These policies typically score 1.5-3 on the capacity scale, providing substantial implementation architecture including specific objectives, legal mandates, and coordination mechanisms. Resources (C2) and Accountability (C4) remain weaker even in this cluster, reflecting their universal challenge across all policies documented earlier.

Crucially, **both clusters contain policies from both income groups**, with income classification showing no strong association with cluster membership. High-income countries produce numerous low-capacity announcements (Cluster 1) alongside their comprehensive frameworks, while developing countries generate some policies achieving Moderate Capacity (Cluster 2) despite resource constraints. This cross-cutting pattern reinforces the central finding that within-group variation dominates: the distinction between low-capacity and moderate-capacity governance proves more consequential than the distinction between high-income and developing countries.

The k = 2 solution — rather than identifying more granular typologies — suggests that the primary governance divide runs between minimal/aspirational policies and those with substantive implementation detail, not between different governance *approaches* or regulatory philosophies. Cluster stability analysis (see @sec-robustness) confirms that k = 2 provides the most robust solution, with higher k values producing unstable clusters that shift substantially across bootstrap samples. This binary structure indicates that AI governance capacity operates more as a continuum from absent to present rather than exhibiting distinct regulatory archetypes like "command-and-control" versus "co-regulatory" approaches that might cluster separately.
