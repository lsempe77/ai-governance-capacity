### Inequality Decomposition {#sec-eth-gini}

The capacity inequality analysis in @sec-cap-inequality demonstrated that 98.8% of governance variation occurs within income groups rather than between them, fundamentally undermining the notion that wealth determines implementation readiness. If this pattern extends to ethics, it would reinforce that ethical governance depends on country-specific political and institutional factors rather than on income-group membership. Alternatively, if ethics shows stronger between-group inequality than capacity, this would suggest that ethical commitments prove more sensitive to economic development than implementation infrastructure — a counterintuitive possibility given the determinants findings showing zero GDP effects on ethics.

Inequality decomposition uses Gini coefficients and Lorenz curves to quantify how ethics scores distribute across policies and countries, then partitions total inequality into between-group and within-group components using Theil decomposition. The Lorenz curve plots cumulative policy share against cumulative ethics share: perfect equality produces a 45-degree line, while inequality generates curves bowing below the diagonal. The Gini coefficient quantifies this bow as the area between the Lorenz curve and the equality line, ranging from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality).

@fig-eth-lorenz visualizes inequality within and between income groups through separate Lorenz curves. The developing-country curve bows further from the equality line than the high-income curve, indicating greater within-group heterogeneity.

| Metric | Value |
|:---|---:|
| Gini (all countries) | 0.569 |
| Gini (HI only) | 0.553 |
| Gini (Developing) | 0.638 |
| Gini (country means) | 0.273 |

: Gini coefficients for ethics scores {#tbl-eth-gini}

@tbl-eth-gini reveals that ethics inequality exceeds capacity inequality across all metrics, reflecting the more severe floor effect (36.3% zeros for ethics vs. 27.6% for capacity). The overall Gini coefficient of 0.569 indicates substantial ethics inequality globally — policies distribute very unevenly on ethical sophistication, with many scoring near-zero and a minority demonstrating comprehensive ethics governance. This 0.569 Gini exceeds capacity's 0.518, suggesting that ethical engagement proves more polarized than implementation readiness: countries either commit substantially to ethics governance or ignore it almost entirely.

The within-group Gini coefficients show a striking asymmetry: **developing countries exhibit higher ethics inequality (0.638) than high-income countries (0.553)**. This 0.085-point gap indicates that developing-country policies vary more dramatically in ethical sophistication than high-income policies. The pattern contrasts with common assumptions that developing countries show more homogeneous (uniformly low) ethics governance. Instead, developing countries span the full ethics spectrum: Kenya, Colombia, Brazil, and Rwanda produce ethics frameworks rivaling or exceeding many high-income countries, while other developing countries produce policies with virtually no ethical content. High-income countries show greater convergence on moderate ethics scores, producing fewer complete failures but also fewer exceptional successes.

The country-means Gini (0.273) measures inequality in average ethics scores across countries rather than across individual policies. This substantially lower coefficient indicates that country averages distribute more equally than individual policies, because averaging within countries smooths out policy-level variation. Yet even country means show meaningful inequality (0.273 > 0), confirming that some countries consistently produce higher-ethics policies than others despite the zero GDP effect demonstrated in @sec-eth-determinants. This inequality apparently reflects political and institutional factors (democratic traditions, civil society strength, governance culture) rather than economic resources.

The overall pattern — high policy-level inequality (0.569), higher within developing countries (0.638) than high-income countries (0.553), modest country-level inequality (0.273) — suggests that country membership explains some but not most ethics variation, and that developing countries show greater diversity in ethical governance approaches than wealthy countries.

#### Theil Decomposition

While Gini coefficients quantify overall inequality, they cannot decompose that inequality into between-group and within-group components. Theil's entropy-based inequality index addresses this limitation through a mathematical property enabling exact additive decomposition. The Theil index measures inequality as the average logarithmic deviation of individual values from the mean, with a key advantage: total inequality equals between-group inequality plus within-group inequality exactly, without residual.

For AI governance, Theil decomposition reveals what proportion of total ethics inequality arises from differences in income-group means (between-group component) versus variation among policies within each income group (within-group component). A large between-group share would indicate that income group membership determines ethics scores, supporting development narratives linking ethics governance to economic capacity. A small between-group share would indicate that within-group variation dominates, confirming that country-specific or policy-specific factors matter far more than income levels.

![Theil decomposition: 99.5% of ethics inequality is within income groups.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_theil_decomposition.png){#fig-eth-theil}

@fig-eth-theil visualizes the decomposition through a stacked bar showing the overwhelming dominance of within-group inequality. The between-group slice proves barely visible, requiring magnification to detect.

| Component | Share |
|:---|---:|
| Between income groups | **0.5%** |
| Within income groups | **99.5%** |

: Theil decomposition for ethics {#tbl-eth-theil}

@tbl-eth-theil delivers an even more extreme version of the capacity finding: **only 0.5% of ethics inequality occurs between income groups**, while **99.5% occurs within income groups**. This 0.5% between-group share proves even smaller than capacity's 1.2%, indicating that income group membership explains virtually nothing about ethical governance quality. If income determined ethics scores, the between-group component would dominate (approaching 100%); instead, it rounds to zero.

The 99.5% within-group inequality means that knowing a policy comes from a high-income versus developing country provides essentially zero information about its ethics score. A developing-country policy has nearly equal probability of scoring very high or very low on ethics, just as a high-income policy spans the full distribution. The modest 0.12-point difference in group means (high-income 0.62 vs. developing 0.50) represents a trivial fraction of the within-group variation (SD ≈ 0.62), producing the near-zero between-group Theil component.

This inequality structure carries profound implications for development policy and international technical assistance. The 99.5% within-group share proves that economic development interventions raising countries from developing to high-income status would do almost nothing to improve ethics governance. A country crossing the high-income threshold would move from a group with mean 0.50 to a group with mean 0.62 — a 0.12-point gain representing 3% of the scale range. But that country would still face the same 99.5% within-group variation determining whether its policies score near zero or approach the maximum. The factors driving that variation — political choices about rights prioritization, institutional traditions of accountability, civil society strength, stakeholder inclusion processes — operate independently of income.

Development interventions should therefore target these within-group factors directly: supporting civil society organizations advocating for rights protections, facilitating multi-stakeholder consultation enabling meaningful inclusion, providing technical assistance on operationalizing ethical principles, and documenting successful cases of developing countries achieving ethics governance sophistication. Assuming that economic growth will automatically generate better ethics governance wastes resources addressing a factor (income) that explains only 0.5% of variation while ignoring the political and institutional factors explaining 99.5%.

### Policy Portfolio Breadth {#sec-eth-portfolio}

The inequality analyses above examined ethics scores on individual policies, but countries produce portfolios of multiple policies that collectively define their governance ecosystems. Portfolio breadth analysis shifts the unit of analysis from policies to countries, asking whether countries cover all five ethics dimensions across their portfolios or show systematic gaps. **Breadth** measures how many of the five ethics dimensions receive non-zero scores in at least one policy within a country's portfolio. A country with 5/5 breadth has produced at least one policy scoring above zero on Framework Depth, Rights Protection, Governance Mechanisms, Operationalisation, and Inclusion. A country with 3/5 breadth has gaps on two dimensions.

Portfolio breadth differs conceptually from score depth: a country could achieve 5/5 breadth with uniformly low scores (0.1 on each dimension in different policies) or achieve 2/5 breadth despite very high scores on covered dimensions. Breadth captures whether governance ecosystems address the full ethics spectrum, while depth (average scores) captures sophistication on covered dimensions.

![Ethics portfolio gap analysis.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_portfolio_gaps.png){#fig-eth-portfolio-gaps}

@fig-eth-portfolio-heatmap visualizes portfolio coverage across countries and dimensions, revealing which dimensions prove universally addressed versus systematically neglected. @fig-eth-portfolio-gaps quantifies the income-group difference in coverage patterns.

| Metric | HI | Developing | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| Mean breadth (out of 5) | 5.00 | 4.36 | .054 |
| Countries with 5/5 coverage | 94% | — | — |
| Least covered dimensions | E2 Rights (94.1%) | E5 Inclusion (94.1%) | — |

: Ethics portfolio breadth {#tbl-eth-portfolio}

@tbl-eth-portfolio shows that the ethics portfolio gap proves **marginally significant** (p = .054), with high-income countries averaging 5.00/5 breadth compared to developing countries' 4.36/5. This near-significance contrasts with capacity portfolio breadth, which showed no income-group difference. High-income countries achieve near-universal coverage with 94% having all five ethics dimensions represented, while developing countries show modest gaps where some dimensions remain completely absent from national policy portfolios.

The dimensions most commonly absent prove telling: **E2 Rights Protection** and **E5 Inclusion** both show 94.1% coverage, meaning that approximately 6% of countries produce no policies addressing these dimensions. This gap carries particular significance because rights protections and stakeholder inclusion directly affect marginalized populations that AI systems disproportionately impact. Developing countries facing severe inequality, weak rule of law, and limited democratic accountability may find these dimensions most consequential for protecting vulnerable populations from algorithmic harms.

The near-universal breadth (4.36/5 for developing countries, 5.00/5 for high-income) indicates that most countries address ethics governance comprehensively across dimensions rather than cherry-picking convenient principles while ignoring difficult ones. This breadth contradicts narratives suggesting that developing countries adopt ethics frameworks superficially for international legitimacy while avoiding substantive commitments. Instead, countries demonstrating any ethics engagement tend toward comprehensive approaches addressing framework depth, rights, governance mechanisms, operationalization, and inclusion together.

The marginal significance (p = .054) suggests that the breadth gap may reflect sample size and measurement precision rather than genuine substantive differences. With larger samples or more sensitive scoring, the gap might disappear entirely, as the capacity portfolio gap did. Alternatively, the gap may reflect that some developing countries focus governance efforts on capacity dimensions (building agencies, allocating budgets, establishing authorities) while deferring ethics articulation until implementation infrastructure exists. This sequencing hypothesis would predict that developing countries achieving high capacity scores subsequently develop ethics frameworks filling portfolio gaps.

### K-Means Clustering {#sec-eth-clusters}

The inequality decomposition demonstrated that 99.5% of variation occurs within income groups, but this finding does not reveal what governance patterns characterize that variation. Cluster analysis identifies whether policies group into distinct ethics profiles — typologies defined by specific dimensional strengths and weaknesses. If clusters prove interpretable and replicable, they provide a taxonomy for describing ethics governance diversity. If clusters prove unstable or uninterpretable, this would suggest that ethics profiles vary continuously rather than forming discrete types.

We employ k-means clustering on the five-dimensional ethics space, testing solutions from k = 2 to k = 6 clusters. The silhouette coefficient measures cluster quality: values near 1.0 indicate well-separated, internally cohesive clusters; values near 0 indicate overlapping or poorly defined clusters. The optimal k balances parsimony (fewer clusters) against fit (higher silhouette scores).

![Cluster profiles for ethics dimensions. Two-cluster solution mirrors the capacity pattern.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_cluster_radar.png){#fig-eth-cluster-radar}

@fig-eth-cluster-radar visualizes the two-cluster solution's dimensional profiles through radar charts showing each cluster's mean on all five ethics dimensions. The radial distance from center indicates score magnitude.

The two-cluster solution for ethics (silhouette = 0.42) mirrors the capacity pattern:

**Cluster 1 ("Ethics-Light")** comprises approximately 65% of policies and demonstrates near-zero scores across all five ethics dimensions. This cluster represents policies that address AI governance through purely technical or operational lenses without engaging ethical considerations. Many sector-specific regulations, procurement guidelines, and technical standards fall into this cluster, treating AI systems as technological artifacts requiring efficiency optimization rather than as socio-technical systems raising normative questions. The cluster's large size (65% of policies) reflects the pervasive pattern identified earlier: 36.3% of policies score exactly zero on ethics, and many additional policies score minimally across dimensions.

**Cluster 2 ("Ethics-Engaged")** comprises approximately 35% of policies and shows moderate scores with particular emphasis on **E1 Framework Depth** and **E3 Governance Mechanisms**. Policies in this cluster explicitly articulate ethical principles (fairness, transparency, accountability, human rights), develop those principles beyond superficial invocations, and establish governance mechanisms to operationalize ethical commitments. National AI strategies, comprehensive ethics frameworks, and binding regulations with rights-protective provisions typically fall into this cluster. The cluster's emphasis on E1 and E3 suggests that policies engaging ethics tend toward systematic approaches articulating frameworks and establishing accountability rather than addressing dimensions piecemeal.

The silhouette score of 0.42 indicates moderate cluster quality — lower than ideal (> 0.50) but substantially above the random baseline (0.0). This moderate quality suggests that ethics governance exhibits some typological structure (ethics-light vs. ethics-engaged) but also substantial within-cluster variation. Policies within the Ethics-Engaged cluster vary considerably in which dimensions they emphasize and how deeply they develop ethical commitments.

Critically, **both clusters contain substantial proportions of high-income and developing-country policies**, confirming the within-group heterogeneity finding from inequality decomposition. Developing countries produce both Ethics-Light policies (technical regulations ignoring normative dimensions) and Ethics-Engaged policies (comprehensive frameworks with rights protections). High-income countries similarly span both clusters. This cross-cutting pattern reinforces that income group membership does not determine ethics governance typology — countries at all income levels choose whether to engage ethics substantively or treat AI governance as purely technical regulation.

The two-cluster solution's robustness across both capacity and ethics (both showing ethics-light vs. engaged typologies with silhouette scores ~0.40) suggests that this binary characterizes AI governance globally: countries either commit to comprehensive normative engagement or focus narrowly on technical implementation without ethical grounding. Effective global governance likely requires both types: technical implementation policies operationalizing ethical principles established in framework documents. Countries producing only Ethics-Light policies risk technocratic governance disconnected from societal values, while countries producing only Ethics-Engaged frameworks without technical implementation risk aspirational principles lacking enforcement mechanisms.
