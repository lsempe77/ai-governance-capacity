## Ethics Inequality and Governance Profiles {#sec-eth-inequality}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** Inequality decomposition for ethics mirrors the capacity findings: 99.5% of variation is within income groups. Portfolio breadth is near-universal, but E2 Rights and E5 Inclusion show the largest coverage gaps.

### Inequality Decomposition {#sec-eth-gini}

![Lorenz curves for ethics scores. Developing countries show higher within-group inequality than HI countries.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_lorenz.png){#fig-eth-lorenz}

| Metric | Value |
|:---|---:|
| Gini (all countries) | 0.569 |
| Gini (HI only) | 0.553 |
| Gini (Developing) | 0.638 |
| Gini (country means) | 0.273 |

: Gini coefficients for ethics scores {#tbl-eth-gini}

Ethics inequality is higher than capacity inequality across all metrics (Gini 0.569 vs. 0.518), reflecting the more pronounced floor effect.

#### Theil Decomposition

![Theil decomposition: 99.5% of ethics inequality is within income groups.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_theil_decomposition.png){#fig-eth-theil}

| Component | Share |
|:---|---:|
| Between income groups | **0.5%** |
| Within income groups | **99.5%** |

: Theil decomposition for ethics {#tbl-eth-theil}

The between-group component is even smaller for ethics (0.5%) than for capacity (1.2%). Income group membership is virtually irrelevant for predicting ethics governance quality.

### Policy Portfolio Breadth {#sec-eth-portfolio}

![Ethics portfolio gap analysis.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/extended/fig_portfolio_gaps.png){#fig-eth-portfolio-gaps}

| Metric | HI | Developing | $p$ |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| Mean breadth (out of 5) | 5.00 | 4.36 | .054 |
| Countries with 5/5 coverage | 94% | — | — |
| Least covered dimensions | E2 Rights (94.1%) | E5 Inclusion (94.1%) | — |

: Ethics portfolio breadth {#tbl-eth-portfolio}

The ethics portfolio gap is *marginally significant* ($p = .054$) — HI countries are slightly more likely to cover all five dimensions. The dimensions most commonly absent are **E2 Rights Protection** and **E5 Inclusion** — precisely the dimensions most relevant to the Global South's specific governance challenges.

### K-Means Clustering {#sec-eth-clusters}

![Cluster profiles for ethics dimensions. Two-cluster solution mirrors the capacity pattern.](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/fig_cluster_radar.png){#fig-eth-cluster-radar}

The two-cluster solution for ethics (silhouette = 0.42) mirrors the capacity pattern:

- **Cluster 1 ("Ethics-Light")**: ~65% of policies, near-zero scores across all dimensions
- **Cluster 2 ("Ethics-Engaged")**: ~35% of policies, moderate scores with emphasis on E1 Framework and E3 Governance

The cluster composition by income group reveals that both clusters contain substantial proportions of both HI and developing-country policies, confirming the within-group heterogeneity finding.
