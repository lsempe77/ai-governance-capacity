## How Robust Are the Findings? {#sec-robustness}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
**Chapter summary.** This chapter subjects the core findings to multiple robustness checks: text quality restrictions, bootstrap confidence intervals, cluster stability analysis, and sensitivity tests. The central finding is that the income-group gap is not robust — it vanishes for good-quality texts.

### The Text Quality Artefact {#sec-text-quality}

All findings in this book depend fundamentally on a methodological assumption: that policy text accurately reflects governance capacity and ethical commitments. This assumption requires that documents available in the OECD.AI Observatory provide sufficient detail for our LLM scoring ensemble to detect capacity and ethics features. If text availability varies systematically by income group — with wealthy countries producing longer, more detailed documents while developing countries produce shorter summaries or excerpts — then apparent governance gaps may reflect measurement artifacts rather than genuine capacity differences.

Text quality presents a particularly insidious confound because it operates through multiple mechanisms. **Length effects** arise mechanically: longer documents provide more opportunities to mention authorities, specify resources, articulate ethical principles, and describe stakeholder inclusion, naturally producing higher scores regardless of governance sophistication. **Detail effects** compound this: even when documents discuss the same governance mechanisms, detailed descriptions score higher than brief mentions. **Extraction effects** add a third layer: some policies are available as complete PDFs enabling full-text analysis, while others appear as brief summaries or metadata excerpts in the Observatory, systematically underrepresenting their actual content.

If developing countries' policies suffer disproportionately from these text quality issues — as the evidence suggests — then the income-group gaps documented throughout this book may substantially overestimate genuine governance differences. Testing robustness to text quality restrictions proves essential for valid inference.

Our most consequential robustness check examines whether the income-group gap survives when restricted to different text quality tiers:

| Sample Restriction | N | Capacity $d$ | Ethics $d$ |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| All texts | 2,097 | **+0.30*** | **+0.20*** |
| **Good-text only (≥500 words)** | 948 | **+0.04 (n.s.)** | **−0.09 (n.s.)** |
| Good + thin | 1,754 | +0.23*** | +0.11 ($p$ = .08) |
| Excluding stubs | 1,754 | +0.23*** | +0.11 ($p$ = .08) |

: Income-group effect sizes by text quality restriction {#tbl-robustness-text}

@tbl-robustness-text delivers the single most consequential finding in the entire book: **the income-group gap in AI governance scores largely vanishes when restricted to policies with adequate text quality**. This finding fundamentally challenges the interpretation of all preceding analyses showing modest but significant income-group differences.

For the **full sample** (all 2,097 policies), the income gaps prove modest but statistically significant: capacity d = +0.30 (p < .001) and ethics d = +0.20 (p < .001). These effect sizes, while "small" by conventional standards (d < 0.30), suggested that high-income countries systematically outperform developing countries on both constructs. Every analysis in Chapters 5-12 documenting income-group comparisons operated on this full sample, finding consistent small advantages for wealthy countries.

But restricting to **good-quality texts only** (≥500 words, n = 948 policies) produces dramatically different results: capacity d = +0.04 (trivial, non-significant) and ethics d = −0.09 (trivial, non-significant, and *reversed in sign*). The capacity gap shrinks by 87% (from 0.30 to 0.04), while the ethics gap not only disappears but inverts — developing countries with well-documented policies slightly outperform high-income countries with equivalent text quality, though this reverse gap also proves statistically insignificant.

The magnitude of this shift proves striking. Cohen's d = 0.04 falls well below any threshold for substantive significance (conventional thresholds: 0.20 = small, 0.50 = medium, 0.80 = large). At d = 0.04, the income-group distributions overlap by approximately 98.5%, meaning that knowing a policy comes from a high-income versus developing country provides essentially zero information about its governance scores once text quality is controlled.

The intermediate restrictions — "good + thin" (excluding only stubs, n = 1,754) and "excluding stubs" (same sample) — produce effect sizes between the extremes: capacity d = 0.23, ethics d = 0.11. These reductions (23% for capacity, 45% for ethics compared to full sample) indicate that removing only the worst-quality texts (stubs < 100 words) partially attenuates the gap, but the full restriction to good-quality texts proves necessary to eliminate it entirely.

**Mechanistic Interpretation**: The text quality confound operates through systematic differences in document availability. High-income countries tend to publish complete policy documents as detailed PDFs with full text available, while developing countries' policies more often appear in the Observatory as brief summaries, metadata entries, or excerpted descriptions. The OECD.AI Observatory's coverage procedures — while comprehensive — cannot always obtain full policy texts for all jurisdictions, particularly those with limited English documentation or restricted document access.

When our LLM ensemble scores a 50-word stub describing a policy's existence, it naturally detects fewer governance features than when scoring a 5,000-word comprehensive strategy. This mechanical length effect artificially depresses developing countries' scores not because their policies lack capacity or ethics, but because the available text lacks sufficient detail for our scoring methodology to detect existing features.

**Interpretive Implications**: This finding requires fundamentally reassessing every income-group comparison throughout the book. The modest gaps documented in Chapters 5-12 may substantially overestimate genuine governance differences. The "true" gap — if we could measure all policies with perfect text quality — likely lies closer to the good-text estimate (d ≈ 0.04) than to the full-sample estimate (d = 0.30).

However, the finding does **not** definitively prove that no capacity gap exists. Three alternative interpretations warrant consideration:

1. **Measurement artifact interpretation** (favored): The apparent gap reflects documentation quality rather than governance quality. Developing countries with resources to produce well-documented policies demonstrate governance quality matching wealthy countries.

2. **Selection interpretation**: Developing countries producing good-quality texts represent a selected subsample of high-capacity countries, while the full developing-country distribution includes many low-capacity countries unable to produce detailed documentation. The good-text restriction may thus eliminate genuine variation.

3. **Hybrid interpretation**: Both mechanisms operate simultaneously. Some apparent gap reflects measurement artifacts, but some reflects genuine capacity differences among developing countries with poor documentation.

The evidence favors the measurement artifact interpretation because the gap doesn't merely shrink with quality restrictions — it essentially disappears and even reverses for ethics. If selection were driving the pattern, we would expect reduced but still-significant gaps as high-capacity developing countries remain in the sample. Instead, we observe near-zero effects suggesting that documentation quality, not governance quality, drives the full-sample gaps.

::: {.callout-warning}
**Interpretive caution.** The text quality finding does not definitively prove that *no* capacity gap exists between income groups — it demonstrates that our measurement methodology cannot reliably detect a gap after controlling for document availability. The "true" gap likely lies between the full-sample estimate (d = 0.30) and the good-text estimate (d = 0.04), but determining its precise magnitude requires improved data collection ensuring equal text quality across all jurisdictions. Policy conclusions should emphasize the fragility of income-group comparisons rather than asserting either complete gap elimination or substantial disadvantage for developing countries.

### Additional Robustness Checks {#sec-additional-robustness}

Beyond the text quality confound, we test robustness to multiple methodological choices: bootstrap resampling, cluster stability, specification alternatives, and temporal subsampling. Full technical details appear in @sec-appendix-robustness; key findings include:

**Bootstrap confidence intervals** confirm statistical precision: capacity d = 0.30 [0.19, 0.41], ethics d = 0.20 [0.09, 0.30] based on 1,000 resamples. The narrow intervals indicate low sampling variability, though this precision must be interpreted alongside the text quality confound showing the estimates are not valid for measuring genuine governance gaps.

**Cluster stability analysis** validates the two-cluster structure ("Low" vs. "Moderate" engagement). Silhouette scores peak at k = 2 (0.41 for capacity, 0.42 for ethics) and decline monotonically for k = 3 through k = 5, confirming that the binary typology represents optimal clustering across both constructs.

**Sensitivity specifications** test six alternative approaches: excluding international organizations, ordinal regression, winsorizing extreme scores, alternative income classifications, varying text quality thresholds (300-1000 words), and temporal subsamples (2017-2020 vs 2021-2025). Core findings prove robust across all specifications: GDP shows modest capacity effects and zero ethics effects, within-group inequality dominates (98-99%), and the income-group gap proves fragile specifically to text quality restrictions rather than to other analytical choices.

The cumulative evidence indicates that substantive conclusions do not depend on arbitrary methodological decisions. The one finding that is **not robust** — the income-group gap itself — proves fragile to text quality restrictions while remaining stable across all other specification choices. This targeted fragility strengthens the interpretation that documentation quality rather than governance quality drives apparent income differences.

### Summary of Robustness Findings

: Summary of robustness checks {#tbl-robustness-summary}

The core analytical findings (GDP effects, inequality structure, diffusion patterns, frontier countries) are highly robust. The one finding that is **not robust** is the income-group gap itself — our single most important caveat for policy interpretation.
