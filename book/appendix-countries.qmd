### Country Rankings — Capacity

See [country_rankings.csv](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/country_rankings.csv) for the full ranking.

The top 10 jurisdictions by mean capacity score are listed in @sec-cap-rankings.

### Country Rankings — Ethics

See [country_rankings.csv](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/country_rankings.csv) for the full ranking.

### Cluster Assignments

Each country is assigned to one of two clusters based on K-means analysis of their mean dimension scores:

- **Cluster 1 ("Low")**: Countries whose average policy scores cluster in the lower range
- **Cluster 2 ("Moderate")**: Countries with above-average governance scores

See [country_clusters.csv](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/country_clusters.csv) for capacity cluster assignments and [country_clusters.csv](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/country_clusters.csv) for ethics cluster assignments.

### Efficiency Frontier Rankings

The efficiency ranking measures how far above or below the GDP-predicted governance score each country falls. See @sec-cap-frontier and @sec-eth-frontier for discussion.

Full rankings are available at:

- [efficiency_ranking.csv](../data/analysis/paper1_capacity/frontier/efficiency_ranking.csv) (capacity)
- [efficiency_ranking.csv](../data/analysis/paper2_ethics/frontier/efficiency_ranking.csv) (ethics)
